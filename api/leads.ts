   POST /api/leads  (public, no auth)
   Body: { email, form?, name?, company?, size?, phone?, smsConsent?,
           page?, website? }

   Every visitor who hands over contact info on carelu.com lands
   here. Leads are appended to leads.json in the PRIVATE
   carelu-sources repo and announced in Slack — demo requests to
   #sales (they are buying signal), every other form to #marketing
   (gated downloads, directory resources) naming the form they
   filled out. Before announcing, Claude enriches the lead from the
   email domain so the ping says who this actually is.

   `website` is a honeypot — bots that fill it get a 200 and are
   dropped. Never blocks the visitor: any storage, enrichment, or
   notification failure still returns 200 so the front-end proceeds.

     SLACK_MARKETING_WEBHOOK_URL -> "Carelu newsletter signup" -> #marketing

   trigger renders only fields matching its declared variables, and a mismatch

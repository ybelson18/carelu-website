        <P>
          LeadTrap, Inc., a Delaware corporation{revealed ? ' doing business as Carelu' : ''} (&ldquo;LeadTrap,&rdquo;
          &ldquo;we,&rdquo; &ldquo;us&rdquo;), provides an AI-powered lead capture, qualification, and intake platform for healthcare
          providers and service businesses. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and
          the choices you have. It applies to leadtrap.com, app.leadtrap.ai, and our chat, phone, SMS, email, and
          advertising-reporting products (the &ldquo;Services&rdquo;).
        </P>

        <H2>1. Information We Collect</H2>
        <P><B>Information you provide.</B> Account details (name, email, phone, company), billing information, and content
          you submit through the Services.</P>
        <P><B>Lead and intake information.</B> When you interact with a LeadTrap chat widget, phone agent, SMS
          conversation, or intake form operated on behalf of one of our business customers (&ldquo;Partners&rdquo;), we
          collect the information you share &mdash; such as your name, contact details, insurance information, and the
          content of your conversation &mdash; on behalf of that Partner and process it under their instructions.</P>
        <P><B>Email data (with your permission).</B> If a Partner connects a Google or Microsoft email account to the
          Services, we access mailbox data through Google and Microsoft APIs solely as described in Section 3.</P>
        <P><B>Advertising data (with your permission).</B> If a Partner connects an advertising account to the
          Services &mdash; Meta (Facebook) or Google Ads &mdash; we access that account&rsquo;s advertising data through
          the platform&rsquo;s official APIs solely as described in Section 4 (Meta) and Section 5 (Google Ads).</P>
        <P><B>Automatic information.</B> Log data, device and browser information, approximate location derived from IP
          address, and usage analytics.</P>

        <H2>2. How We Use Information</H2>
        <P>We use information to provide and operate the Services; route, qualify, and follow up with leads on behalf of
          Partners; send and receive communications the Partner has configured (chat, SMS, phone, email); provide
          reporting and analytics to Partners; secure and improve the Services; and comply with law.</P>
        <P>We do <B>not</B> sell personal information. We do <B>not</B> use lead or intake information for advertising.</P>

        <H2>3. Google and Microsoft Account Data</H2>
        <P>This section covers data we receive through Google and Microsoft APIs. A Partner may connect a <B>mailbox</B>
          (described here) and, separately, a <B>Google Ads</B> account (described in Section 5). The Google API{' '}
          <B>Limited Use</B> commitments set out below apply to all Google user data we receive, including Google Ads
          data.</P>
        <P>If a Partner connects a Gmail or Microsoft Outlook account, LeadTrap accesses that mailbox only to provide
          user-facing features the Partner has enabled &mdash; such as sending intake follow-up emails from the
          Partner&rsquo;s address, reading replies from leads so they appear in the Partner&rsquo;s LeadTrap inbox, and
          organizing those messages (for example, marking them as read or labeled once handled).</P>
        <P>LeadTrap&rsquo;s use and transfer of information received from Google APIs adheres to the{' '}
          <a href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy" style={link} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google API Services User Data Policy</a>,
          including the <B>Limited Use</B> requirements. Specifically:</P>
        <ul style={{ margin: '0 0 14px', paddingLeft: 22 }}>
          <LI>We only use Google user data to provide and improve the user-facing features described in this policy
            &mdash; the mailbox features described above and the advertising-reporting features described in Section
            5.</LI>
          <LI>We do <B>not</B> transfer Google user data to third parties except as necessary to provide these features,
            to comply with applicable law, or as part of a merger or acquisition with notice.</LI>
          <LI>We do <B>not</B> use Google user data for advertising, including our own advertising and any ad targeting
            or retargeting. (Showing a Partner their own Google Ads performance inside their dashboard is a user-facing
            reporting feature they asked for, not advertising use of their data.)</LI>
          <LI>We do <B>not</B> allow humans to read Google user data unless we have the account holder&rsquo;s affirmative
            agreement, it is necessary for security or compliance purposes, or the data has been aggregated and
            anonymized.</LI>
          <LI>We do <B>not</B> use Google user data &mdash; including Google Workspace, Gmail, and Google Ads data
            &mdash; to develop, improve, or train generalized artificial intelligence or machine-learning models.</LI>
        </ul>
        <P>Microsoft account data accessed through Microsoft Graph is handled under the same restrictions. Partners can
          disconnect a mailbox at any time from their LeadTrap settings, which revokes our access; previously synced data
          can be deleted on request.</P>

        <H2>4. Meta (Facebook and Instagram) Advertising Data</H2>
        <P>Partners may connect a Meta (Facebook) account to the Services &mdash; through our Meta app,{' '}
          <B>Carelu Connector</B> &mdash; so they can see how their Facebook and Instagram advertising performs alongside
          the leads and intakes those ads generate. Access is granted by the Partner through Facebook Login and
          Meta&rsquo;s permission dialogs, and we access Meta data only through Meta&rsquo;s official APIs (including the
          Marketing API).</P>
        <P><B>What we receive.</B> With the Partner&rsquo;s permission, we receive: basic profile information of the
          connecting user (such as name and email address); the ad accounts, Pages, and business assets the Partner
          chooses to share; and advertising data from those assets &mdash; such as campaign, ad set, and ad names and
          settings, and aggregate performance metrics (for example spend, impressions, reach, clicks, and conversion
          counts).</P>
        <P><B>How we use it.</B> We use Meta data only to provide the features the Partner has enabled: displaying
          advertising performance in that Partner&rsquo;s LeadTrap dashboard, attributing leads and intakes to the
          campaigns that generated them, and reporting on the results. Specifically:</P>
        <ul style={{ margin: '0 0 14px', paddingLeft: 22 }}>
          <LI>We do <B>not</B> sell Meta data or use it for our own advertising or marketing.</LI>
          <LI>We do <B>not</B> share Meta data with third parties, except with service providers who host and operate the
            Services for us under contract, or where required by law. Each Partner&rsquo;s Meta data is visible only to
            that Partner&rsquo;s account.</LI>
          <LI>We do <B>not</B> use Meta data to build or train generalized artificial-intelligence or machine-learning
            models.</LI>
          <LI>Access tokens for connected Meta accounts are stored encrypted and are never shared.</LI>
        </ul>
        <P>Our collection, use, and deletion of Meta data (&ldquo;Platform Data&rdquo;) complies with the{' '}
          <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/terms/" style={link} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Meta Platform Terms</a> and{' '}
          <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/devpolicy/" style={link} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Developer Policies</a>.</P>
        <P><B>Disconnecting and data deletion.</B> A Partner can disconnect their Meta account at any time from their
          LeadTrap settings, which revokes our access. You can also remove the &ldquo;Carelu Connector&rdquo; app yourself
          in your Facebook settings under <B>Settings &amp; Privacy &rarr; Settings &rarr; Apps and Websites</B>, which
          invalidates our access tokens. To have the Meta data we have stored deleted, disconnect (or remove the app) and
          email <a href="mailto:privacy@leadtrap.com" style={link}>privacy@leadtrap.com</a> from the account
          owner&rsquo;s address with the subject &ldquo;Meta data deletion request.&rdquo; We will delete the stored Meta
          data associated with the connection within 30 days and confirm by email.</P>

        <H2>5. Google Ads Advertising Data</H2>
        <P>Partners may connect a <B>Google Ads</B> account to the Services so they can see how their Google advertising
          performs alongside the leads and intakes those ads generate. Access is granted by the Partner through
          Google&rsquo;s OAuth consent screen, and we access Google Ads data only through the official Google Ads API,
          using the <span style={code}>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/adwords</span> scope.</P>
        <P><B>What we receive.</B> Read-only, and limited to the Partner&rsquo;s own advertising data: the list of Google
          Ads accounts the connecting user is able to access; basic details of the account the Partner selects (account
          name, currency, and time zone); and campaign performance &mdash; campaign ID and name with daily spend, clicks,
          and impressions. This data is refreshed on a nightly schedule that re-pulls roughly the last 35 days, so
          late-reported figures and spend corrections are picked up. We do <B>not</B> request or receive the connecting
          user&rsquo;s Gmail, contacts, calendar, Google profile, or any other Google data through this connection.</P>
        <P><B>Read-only access.</B> We only read. We never create, edit, pause, or delete campaigns, ad groups, ads,
          budgets, or bids, and we never spend money in a Partner&rsquo;s Google Ads account. The connection makes no
          changes of any kind to the account.</P>
        <P><B>How we use it.</B> We use Google Ads data only to provide the features the Partner has enabled: displaying
          advertising performance in that Partner&rsquo;s LeadTrap dashboard, attributing leads and intakes to the
          campaigns that generated them, and reporting on the results (for example, cost per lead by campaign).
          Specifically:</P>
        <ul style={{ margin: '0 0 14px', paddingLeft: 22 }}>
          <LI>We do <B>not</B> sell Google Ads data or use it for our own advertising or marketing.</LI>
          <LI>We do <B>not</B> share Google Ads data with third parties, except with service providers who host and
            operate the Services for us under contract, or where required by law. Each Partner&rsquo;s Google Ads data is
            visible only to that Partner&rsquo;s account.</LI>
          <LI>We do <B>not</B> use Google Ads data to develop, improve, or train generalized artificial-intelligence or
            machine-learning models.</LI>
          <LI>We do <B>not</B> allow humans to read Google Ads data except with the account holder&rsquo;s affirmative
            agreement, where necessary for security or compliance, or where the data has been aggregated and
            anonymized.</LI>
        </ul>
        <P>Our use and transfer of information received from Google APIs, including the Google Ads API, adheres to the{' '}
          <a href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy" style={link} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google API Services User Data Policy</a>,
          including the <B>Limited Use</B> requirements set out in Section 3.</P>
        <P><B>Disconnecting and stored data.</B> A Partner can disconnect their Google Ads account at any time from their
          LeadTrap settings. Disconnecting stops the nightly sync, revokes our access, and clears the stored OAuth tokens
          for that connection. You can also revoke LeadTrap&rsquo;s access yourself at any time at{' '}
          <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/permissions" style={link} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">myaccount.google.com/permissions</a>.
          Advertising performance that has already been synced (daily spend, clicks, and impressions by campaign) is{' '}
          <B>kept</B> after disconnection so the Partner&rsquo;s past reports remain intact. To have it deleted, email{' '}
          <a href="mailto:privacy@leadtrap.com" style={link}>privacy@leadtrap.com</a> from the account owner&rsquo;s
          address with the subject &ldquo;Google Ads data deletion request.&rdquo; We will delete the stored Google Ads
          data associated with the connection within 30 days and confirm by email.</P>

        <H2>6. SMS / Text Messaging</H2>
        <P>Leads may receive SMS messages from a Partner via LeadTrap only after providing consent &mdash; for example, by
          submitting a form or chat conversation that discloses SMS follow-up, or by texting in first. Message frequency
          varies; message and data rates may apply. Reply <B>STOP</B> to opt out at any time and <B>HELP</B> for help.</P>
        <P><B>No mobile opt-in data is shared with third parties or affiliates for marketing or promotional purposes.</B>{' '}
          Text messaging originator opt-in data and consent are not shared with any third parties, except as necessary to
          deliver the messages (e.g., our SMS carrier partners) or as required by law.</P>

        <H2>7. Sharing</H2>
        <P>We share information with: the Partner on whose behalf a conversation occurs; service providers who process
          data for us under contract (hosting, telephony/SMS carriers, payment processing, analytics); and authorities
          when required by law. We may share aggregated, de-identified information that cannot reasonably identify you.</P>

        <H2>8. Data Retention and Deletion</H2>
        <P>We retain personal information for as long as needed to provide the Services to the relevant Partner, then
          delete or de-identify it. Partners may request deletion of lead data at any time; account holders may request
          deletion of their account data by contacting{' '}
          <a href="mailto:privacy@leadtrap.com" style={link}>privacy@leadtrap.com</a>.</P>

        <H2>9. Security</H2>
        <P>We use industry-standard safeguards, including encryption in transit (TLS) and at rest, access controls, and
          least-privilege internal access. OAuth tokens for connected email accounts are stored encrypted and are never
          shared.</P>

        <H2>10. Your Rights</H2>
        <P>Depending on where you live, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, or port your personal
          information, and to opt out of certain processing. Contact{' '}
          <a href="mailto:privacy@leadtrap.com" style={link}>privacy@leadtrap.com</a> to exercise these rights. If we
          process your data on behalf of a Partner, we may direct your request to that Partner.</P>

        <H2>11. Children</H2>
        <P>The Services are not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect their information without
          appropriate consent obtained by the Partner (e.g., a parent completing intake for a child&rsquo;s care).</P>

        <H2>12. Changes and Contact</H2>
        <P>We will post any changes to this policy on this page with an updated effective date. Questions:{' '}

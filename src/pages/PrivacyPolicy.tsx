          This Privacy Policy explains how LeadTrap, Inc., a Delaware corporation doing business as Carelu
          (&ldquo;Carelu,&rdquo; &ldquo;we,&rdquo; &ldquo;us,&rdquo; or &ldquo;our&rdquo;), handles information in

        </P>
        <P>
          <B>Scope.</B> This policy covers the Site. Information processed through the Carelu product on behalf of a
          provider &mdash; including any Protected Health Information (PHI) &mdash; is governed by our{' '}
          <a href="/terms" style={{ color: '#2e5a26', fontWeight: 600 }}>Terms of Service</a> and, where applicable, a
          signed Business Associate Agreement (BAA), not by this Site policy. We do not collect PHI through this Site.
          Three exceptions: our handling of data from email accounts a provider connects to the Carelu product (Google
          or Microsoft) is described in <a href="#connected-email" style={{ color: '#2e5a26', fontWeight: 600 }}>Connected
          Google and Microsoft accounts</a> below; our handling of data from Meta (Facebook) accounts a provider

          advertising accounts (Meta)</a>; and our handling of data from Google Ads accounts a provider connects is

        <P><B>Business / firmographic data.</B> We use a third-party visitor-identification service (Snitcher) that may
          infer the <em>company or organization</em> associated with a visitor&rsquo;s IP address so we can understand
          which businesses are interested in Carelu. This identifies organizations, not named individuals, and runs only

        <H2 id="connected-email">Connected Google and Microsoft accounts</H2>
        <P>
          This section covers data we receive through Google and Microsoft APIs. A provider may connect a <B>mailbox</B>{' '}
          (described here) and, separately, a <B>Google Ads</B> account (described under{' '}
          <a href="#connected-google-ads" style={{ color: '#2e5a26', fontWeight: 600 }}>Connected advertising accounts

          receive, including Google Ads data.
        </P>
        <P>
          Providers using the Carelu product may connect a Google (Gmail) or Microsoft (Outlook) email account. With the
          account holder&rsquo;s permission, Carelu accesses that mailbox only to provide user-facing features the
          provider has enabled &mdash; such as sending intake follow-up emails from the provider&rsquo;s address, reading
          replies from families so they appear in the provider&rsquo;s Carelu inbox, and organizing those messages (for
          example, marking them as read or labeled once handled). Providers can disconnect a mailbox at any time from
          their Carelu settings, which revokes our access; previously synced data is deleted on request.
        </P>
        <P>
          Carelu&rsquo;s use and transfer of information received from Google APIs adheres to the{' '}

        <ul style={{ margin: '0 0 14px', paddingLeft: 22 }}>
          <LI>we only use Google user data to provide and improve the user-facing features described in this policy

          <LI>we do not transfer Google user data to third parties except as necessary to provide these features, to

          <LI>we do not use Google user data for advertising, including our own advertising and any ad targeting or
            retargeting (showing a provider their own Google Ads performance inside their dashboard is a user-facing
            reporting feature they asked for, not advertising use of their data);</LI>
          <LI>we do not allow humans to read Google user data unless we have the account holder&rsquo;s affirmative

        <H2 id="connected-meta">Connected advertising accounts (Meta)</H2>
        <P>
          Providers using the Carelu product may connect a Meta (Facebook) account through our Meta app,{' '}
          <B>Carelu Connector</B>, so they can see how their Facebook and Instagram advertising performs alongside the
          leads and intakes those ads generate. Access is granted by the provider through Facebook Login and
          Meta&rsquo;s permission dialogs, and Carelu accesses Meta data only through Meta&rsquo;s official APIs
          (including the Marketing API).
        </P>
        <P>
          <B>What we receive.</B> With the provider&rsquo;s permission, we receive: basic profile information of the
          connecting user (such as name and email address); the ad accounts, Pages, and business assets the provider
          chooses to share; and advertising data from those assets &mdash; such as campaign, ad set, and ad names and

          counts).

          that generated them, and reporting on the results. We do not sell Meta data or use it for our own advertising;
          we do not share it with third parties except service providers who host and operate the product for us under
          contract, or where required by law; we do not use it to build or train generalized artificial-intelligence or

          spend, clicks, and impressions, refreshed nightly over roughly the last 35 days so late-reported figures and
          spend corrections are picked up. We do <B>not</B> request or receive the connecting user&rsquo;s Gmail,

          campaigns that generated them, and reporting on the results (for example, cost per lead by campaign). We do
          not sell Google Ads data or use it for our own advertising; we do not share it with third parties except
          service providers who host and operate the product for us under contract, or where required by law, and each

    intro: [
      'Ohio Medicaid covers ABA — "adaptive behavior services" — for the assessment and treatment of autism spectrum disorder under Ohio Administrative Code rule 5160-34-02. Ohio runs heavily through its Next Generation managed-care plans, several of which layer genuinely distinct clinical policies on the state rule, so the per-plan guides below matter more here than in most states. Two facts worth knowing cold: OhioRISE (Aetna) never pays for ABA — the member\'s MCO does, even for OhioRISE-enrolled youth — and ODM has a pending rewrite of the ABA chapter that would loosen assessment PA.',

          'Watch the pending rewrite: ODM has drafted new rules 5160-34-01 through -03 that would, among other changes, require assessment PA only beyond 10 hours per 180 days and remove specific diagnostic-condition requirements. The broken codes.ohio.gov citation flagged in earlier reviews now has a documented cause: per ODM\'s own 7/30/2026 provider stakeholder presentation, the ABA rule package was paused in 2025 for reevaluation — a mix of state budget pressure, national scrutiny of ABA spending, and state OIG audit findings elsewhere citing improper-payment takebacks ($56.5M in Indiana, $17.3M in Massachusetts, $18.5M in Wisconsin, $42.6M in Colorado, cited by ODM for context on why ABA rules are under review nationally). The chapter is under active revision again, with provider comments on the current draft due 8/5/2026, but no JCARR (Joint Committee on Agency Rule Review) filing exists yet — it remains pre-filing, not adopted law, so nothing below has changed. codes.ohio.gov\'s live page for rule 5160-34-02 still returns "no rule number corresponds" as of this review, and the entire 5160-34 chapter is still missing from the Title 5160 master chapter index; confirm current rule status with Rules@Medicaid.Ohio.gov or JCARR before relying on the codes.ohio.gov citation below.',

Draft rule 5160-34-03 would introduce a two-tier intensity structure — Comprehensive (10–25 hrs/week) vs. Focused (1–20 hrs/week) — restrict eligibility to ASD only, require a diagnosing/referring practitioner who is independent of (not employed by) the ABA provider, require 4 hours/month of parent participation, and explicitly ban billing ABA under non-ABA/behavioral-health codes.

          'Ohio layers no separate technician license or state registry on top of the BACB — behavior technicians are RBTs, so the BACB\'s own bar is the employee-level floor: applicants must be at least 18 with a high-school education, complete the 40-hour training and initial competency assessment, and pass both a criminal background check and an abuse-registry check no more than 180 days before applying (the BACB itself doesn\'t require fingerprinting). The pending rule rewrite (draft 5160-34-01) would formalize this — defining the RBT as a BACB-certified paraprofessional under close, ongoing supervision of a COBA, BCBA, or BCBA-D — and would add a 90-day "exam-eligible RBT" window: a technician who has finished the coursework and competency assessment could render supervised services for 90 days from exam eligibility, documented on form ODM 10391, then must be certified or stop rendering. As of the May 2025 clearance package that chapter was still marked draft and not yet filed — hire to the BACB requirements today and re-check when it files.',
          'Screening runs at two levels, and it pays to keep them straight. At the supervisor level, COBA applicants must complete a fingerprint-based BCI criminal-records check that includes an FBI check (OAC 4783-4-03) — the Board of Psychology accepts results only directly from BCI, won\'t issue the certificate without acceptable results, and the applicant bears the cost (the board doesn\'t currently publish COBA application fees in a retrievable form — confirm directly). At the organization level, OAC 5160-1-17.8 runs the database battery at enrollment and revalidation: the provider and every 5%-or-greater owner or managing agent are screened against the HHS-OIG exclusion list, SAM, the Medicare Exclusion Database, other states\' Medicaid termination lists, the ODH nurse aide registry, and the DODD abuser registry — a hit disqualifies the provider agreement (the appendix assigning ABA Provider Type 19\'s screening risk level wasn\'t retrievable; high-risk types add owner fingerprinting). One trap: Ohio\'s ARCS registry-check mandates (OAC 5123-2-02) bind DODD-system and waiver staff, not state-plan ABA — no Ohio rule mandates employee-level fingerprints for state-plan-only RBTs, so the BACB 180-day check plus mirroring the OIG/SAM exclusion checks on all staff is the operative standard.',
          'Supervision is where Ohio is unusual: OAC 4783-6-02 requires the COBA to build a written supervision plan into each client\'s treatment plan — naming every supervisee, their relationship to the client, and their responsibilities, with the amount and type of training and supervision specified — and mandates consultation before plan initiation and before any modification plus periodic direct observation, but sets no fixed ratio; frequency and intensity are the COBA\'s documented judgment, and client assessment, treatment-plan development, and efficacy review can never be delegated. The quantitative floor comes from the plans instead: Optum/UHC\'s Ohio Medicaid criteria (effective 7/1/2026) require 1–2 hours of direct case supervision per 10 hours of direct treatment per week, citing CASP standards, and CareSource\'s MM-0028 requires supervision records retained 5 years (COBAs) or 7 years (BCBAs/RBTs) after supervision ends — with claims tied to documentation discrepancies subject to recoupment.

      'Humana Healthy Horizons in Ohio administers ABA on the state clinical framework with the cleanest all-codes PA statement of the seven plans: its prior-authorization list (effective January 2026) names every ABA code — 97151 through 97158, 0362T, and 0373T — with no assessment exemption. There\'s no distinct Humana clinical policy layered on top; what the plan adds is in-house behavioral UM, Availity logistics, and a sharp consequence for skipping the process.',

Services rendered without PA are subject to retrospective medical-necessity review and financial penalties, which converts a skipped authorization into a revenue write-off risk. Submissions run through Availity Essentials (registration at 800-AVAILITY), with the Ohio provider line at (877) 856-5707. Clinical criteria follow the state framework — DSM-5-TR diagnosis, 6-month reviews — and the OhioRISE rule holds: ABA bills to Humana, never to OhioRISE.',

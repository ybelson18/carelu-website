Since then the model is fully managed-care: Horizon NJ Health, Aetna Better Health, Fidelis Care, UnitedHealthcare Community Plan, and Wellpoint each prior-authorize and pay ABA through their own networks. The one big exception is a genuine intake asset: members still pending MCO enrollment are covered fee-for-service through Gainwell Technologies — and no prior authorization is required at all while a member is in that pending-enrollment window. The state also publishes real FFS rates and a daily unit guide, which the MCOs have largely adopted as claim edits.',

Fee-for-service — billed to Gainwell Technologies, the fiscal agent — applies only to members pending MCO enrollment, and critically, no prior authorization is required while a member sits in that FFS window. For intake, that makes enrollment status a first-order routing question: a newly eligible child who hasn\'t been assigned a plan yet can start without any authorization at all, then transitions to the MCO\'s process once assigned. FFS ABA providers enroll through a dedicated "Applied Behavior Analysis Treatment Provider" packet, including fingerprint background checks per N.J.A.C. 10:77-4.9(g). DMAHS runs a dedicated Autism Line for ABA and DIR services: 609-588-8522 / MAHS.ASDinquiries@dhs.nj.gov.

Licensure: New Jersey requires the Licensed Applied Behavior Analyst (LBA) credential — master\'s or doctorate plus current BCBA plus the NJ jurisprudence exam — with the assistant-level LaBA under an identified supervisor, per N.J.S.A. 45:8B-91 et seq. and N.J.A.C. 13:42B; the board\'s position is that supervision itself constitutes practicing behavior analysis and requires a license, while RBTs remain unlicensed under a licensee.

          'At the technician level, New Jersey layers a Medicaid credential on an unlicensed role. The founding DMAHS newsletter names the RBT as the technician provider — high school diploma or GED, the 40-hour training, a passed competency exam, and "close, ongoing supervision" by a BCBA-D, BCBA, or BCaBA — and its provider-specialty table lists RBT (alongside BCaBA) as the permitted renderer of 97152/97153. The state itself doesn\'t license technicians: N.J.S.A. 45:8B-103.b(2) exempts "paraprofessional technicians" delivering ABA under a licensee\'s direction, and the board\'s rules (N.J.A.C. 13:42B-1.2, effective May 6, 2024) expressly fold BACB-certified RBTs into that exempt category. MCO manuals run looser — Optum\'s 2022 NJ orientation asks only that behavior technicians be high school graduates with appropriate BCBA training and supervision, and Horizon says RBT certification is "preferred," not required — but because state FFS policy makes RBT the operative credential, hire to the RBT standard to satisfy the strictest applicable rule. That standard carries its own screening: the BACB\'s RBT 2026 requirements demand age 18+, a criminal background check plus an abuse-registry check reviewed by an attestor, the updated 40-hour training (delivered by BCBAs/BCaBAs who\'ve completed the 8-hour supervision training), and the RBT Initial Competency Assessment.',
          'Background-check obligations split by role. LBA and LaBA applicants clear a criminal history check as part of licensure — the board\'s FAQ notes application processing time depends partly on its completion — coordinated through the Division of Consumer Affairs\' Criminal History Review Unit, which runs FBI and state (SBI) fingerprint checks via New Jersey\'s contracted live-scan vendor (the CHRU\'s published board list hadn\'t yet named the ABA board when checked in mid-2026). For unlicensed technicians, no NJ statute or FamilyCare ABA policy mandating fingerprint or child-abuse-registry checks was found — the BACB\'s RBT screening is the floor, supplemented by whatever your MCO contracts add (agency-level fingerprinting at FFS enrollment, per N.J.A.C. 10:77-4.9(g), is a separate provider-enrollment matter — see above). What binds every hire regardless of role is exclusion screening: NJ guidance (updated January 2023, an obligation the state has run since 2010) requires Medicaid providers and MCOs to verify monthly that current and prospective employees, contractors, and subcontractors aren\'t excluded, unlicensed, or uncertified — searching the NJ debarment list, the federal OIG LEIE, the NJ Treasurer\'s exclusions database, and where applicable the Consumer Affairs and Department of Health licensure databases.',
          'On the supervisory side, licensure is now operational, not just on paper: P.L.2019, c.337 created the Board of Applied Behavior Analyst Examiners and bars unlicensed practice, board rules took effect May 6, 2024, applications opened September 12, 2024, and by February 2026 there were 3,506 active licensees (3,476 LBAs, 30 LaBAs). LBAs need a graduate degree plus current BCBA certification; LaBAs a bachelor\'s plus BCaBA plus an identified LBA supervisor — with supervision floors of at least 5% of practice hours weekly (or one hour every two weeks, whichever is more) in the first year, dropping to 2% or one hour monthly thereafter, face-to-face, under a supervisor who has completed the BACB 8-hour supervisor training. An LBA may delegate intervention implementation to technicians but not assessment, treatment-plan development, or intervention design — and the board holds that supervision in all its forms is itself licensed practice. Two clocks worth tracking in hiring plans: providers working under DDD contracts must hold licenses by May 6, 2027 and Early Intervention contractors by May 6, 2029, while school-district employees delivering ABA solely for their district remain exempt.',

Treatment is where the review lives: the post-assessment ABA Request Form goes back through NaviNet, a UM clinician reviews against MCG criteria, requests are reviewed within 14 days of receipt, and approved cases get 6-month authorizations. Two hard edges: Horizon enforces the state\'s daily MUE unit limits ("shall not consider for reimbursement units exceeding the daily maximum as clinically authorized"), and claims above authorized units are not reimbursed — so the authorization, not the treatment plan, is the billing ceiling.',

Substantively it follows the state benefit design — but wraps it in Optum\'s Provider Express intake, forms, and documentation culture, a different operational world from the state baseline.

It also enumerates the QHP roles and permits services in the school setting as long as they don\'t occur during normal school hours — a newer, looser position than the state\'s 2020 "no school facility" rule.

The statute\'s headline limitation, a $36,000/year ABA cap, is largely dead: DOBI Bulletin 10-02 held the cap cannot be applied to group health plans subject to MHPAEA, because New Jersey classifies autism as a biologically-based mental illness and dollar limits conflict with federal parity — leaving it live mainly in nongroup policies. The IHC and SEH program boards went further in amendments effective January 2015, extending ABA to adults 21+ and removing therapy visit limits in the individual and small-employer markets. Practical current state: state-regulated plans cover medically necessary ABA without dollar caps. Self-funded ERISA plans remain exempt and may exclude ABA entirely.',

    intro: [
      'Florida Medicaid covers ABA as "Behavior Analysis (BA) Services" for recipients under 21 — and its front door is one of the widest in the country: no autism diagnosis is required. Eligibility turns on behavior that impairs a major life activity, gated by an independent physician\'s referral. The structure changed fundamentally on February 1, 2025, when SMMC 3.0 carved BA INTO the nine Managed Medical Assistance plans: most families now get BA through their plan\'s network with prior authorization routed to the plan, while the shrinking fee-for-service remainder still authorizes through Acentra Health\'s eQSuite. The trade-off for the wide front door is heavy documentation (Vineland-3 and BASC-3 with every request) and some of the lowest ABA rates in the Southeast.',

          'For years Florida ran BA as a fee-for-service carve-out with all prior authorization through eQHealth (now Acentra Health). SMMC 3.0 ended that on February 1, 2025: BA moved into the nine MMA plans — Aetna Better Health, Children\'s Medical Services Health Plan, Community Care Plan, Florida Community Care, Humana Healthy Horizons, Molina, Simply Healthcare, Sunshine Health, and UnitedHealthcare Community Plan. If the family is enrolled in an MMA plan, the plan\'s process (portal, UM vendor, fax, turnaround) governs the PA; only recipients NOT enrolled in a plan remain fee-for-service with authorization through Acentra\'s eQSuite portal at fl.acentra.com (customer service 855-444-3747). At the transition, plans had to honor pre-existing Acentra authorizations — AHCA\'s baseline was ~90 days of auth protection, and UHC, Humana, and Florida Community Care each publicly committed to 120 days plus paying non-par providers at prior rates. The first intake question in Florida is therefore: which plan — because it decides where the paperwork goes.',
          'One guardrail keeps the nine plans aligned: the coverage policy requires managed care plans to comply with its service coverage requirements and forbids more stringent limits than Florida Medicaid policy. Plans differ on process — portals, delegated UM vendors, faxes — not clinical criteria. The per-plan guides below cover those mechanics.',

What gates entry instead is a referral from an independent physician or practitioner (a PCP in family practice, internal medicine, or pediatrics; a developmental-behavioral or neurodevelopmental pediatrician; a pediatric neurologist; a psychiatrist; or a child psychologist), and that referral must include a physician\'s order for BA services plus a Comprehensive Diagnostic Evaluation (CDE) performed to national evidence-based practice standards, led by a licensed practitioner.

          'Florida licenses no behavior analysts: s. 393.17, F.S. instead recognizes certification from a national credentialing board — the BACB — and the FL-CBA is a closed legacy credential (the BACB absorbed the old state program in October 2003; no new FL-CBAs are issued, and a lapsed one requires requalifying as a BCBA). Under the December 2024 coverage policy, technicians must be BACB-credentialed RBTs working under a BCBA or BCaBA, and the Lead Analyst on every case must be a BCBA, an FL-CBA, or a practitioner licensed under chapter 490 or 491. The policy adds no training hours beyond the BACB\'s own RBT requirements (40-hour training, competency assessment, exam, plus the BACB\'s own criminal-background and abuse-registry check within 180 days of applying). The staffing catch is enrollment: every rendering practitioner individually enrolls in Florida Medicaid — Lead Analysts as provider type 392, BCaBAs as 391, RBTs as 390, with 390s and 391s enrollable only as members of an enrolled BA group (type 393). Each application needs a color copy of the BACB certification matching the applicant\'s legal name (black-and-white copies are rejected) and a completed background screening — AHCA says missing screenings and missing tax-ID proof are the two most common causes of BA application delays.',
          'The background screening reaches far past owners: s. 409.907(8)(a), F.S. requires a Level 2 screening not just for the provider and each principal (officers, directors, managing employees, 5%+ owners) but for anyone who participates "by way of rendering services to Medicaid recipients or having direct access to Medicaid recipients" — i.e., every RBT, BCaBA, and analyst on the schedule. Mechanics: the employer initiates the screening through the Care Provider Background Screening Clearinghouse; the candidate submits fingerprints and a photo at an approved Livescan provider; FDLE runs the statewide check and the FBI the national one, plus sex-offender registry searches in states of residence over the preceding 5 years; the eligibility determination must be in hand before employment begins, and for Medicaid enrollment the screening must be within the last 5 years. Prints are retained — FDLE automatically reports new Florida arrests against them — and the employer must initiate a Clearinghouse renewal via the Clearinghouse Results Website before the 5-year expiration (the window opens 60 days out); miss it and the prints drop, the determination expires, and the employee re-fingerprints at a Livescan provider at higher cost. Since January 1, 2024, employers must also register with the Clearinghouse and report employment-status changes within 5 business days. One honest gap: neither the coverage policy nor AHCA\'s BA enrollment materials publish an OIG-LEIE/SAM.gov exclusion-screening cadence for BA staff — federal exclusion-screening obligations still apply, so set your own monthly-check policy rather than waiting for a state instruction.',
          'Supervision floors: Florida sets no numeric ratio in rule. The coverage policy instead requires all BA services — including supervision of BCaBAs and RBTs — to follow "current practice standards as published by the Council of Autism Service Providers," as laid out in the supervision plan inside the approved behavior plan (which must name the authorized supervisors). The incorporated CASP standard is 1–2 hours of case supervision per 10 hours of direct treatment; the BACB\'s 5%-of-monthly-hours minimum for RBTs remains the floor underneath. Supervision is billable — the supervisor can be reimbursed for observing a supervisee implementing the plan, but the supervisee isn\'t paid for the same time period. At the plan level, the two MMA plans checked (Simply/Carelon and Humana) layer only administrative credentialing and portal registration on top — no evidence of employee-level screening beyond the AHCA Level 2/Clearinghouse baseline, which already covers every rendering practitioner through enrollment.',

We could not verify this against a Sunshine primary source (the plan\'s newsroom blocks automated access), so treat it as a flagged, unconfirmed report: if you\'re adding BCBAs or RBTs to a Sunshine-contracted group, confirm current enrollment status with your provider-relations contact before promising start dates.',
          'A confirmed, primary-sourced rule as of July 15, 2026: Sunshine will not carry an authorization over when a member switches BA providers. The new provider must submit a brand-new initial authorization request (starting at 24 units before treatment codes are added), obtain its own current Vineland-3/BASC-3 assessments rather than relying on the prior provider\'s documentation, and file a Change of Provider Form — Sunshine explicitly states it will not accept the outgoing provider\'s paperwork to carry the case forward. Build this into any transfer-of-care intake: a family switching BA providers restarts the authorization clock, it doesn\'t transfer it.',
          'A second, newer rule layers on top, effective August 1, 2026: every NEW BA authorization request must include a "PCP Acknowledgement and Care Coordination Form," per a Sunshine newsroom notice published July 31, 2026. Sunshine\'s own language is blunt about the stakes: "Authorizations submitted on or after August 1, 2026, will not be approved without this form." The PCP reviews the member/provider information on the form and confirms awareness of the BA services and any care-coordination considerations — but does NOT determine BA hours, approve the treatment plan, or make the authorization decision itself; that stays with Sunshine\'s UM process. Two mechanics worth building into intake workflow: the form must be updated annually, but the ORIGINAL signed document has to be resubmitted with EVERY prior-authorization request, not just once a year — and this form is additive, layering on top of (not replacing) the existing CDE, Vineland-3, and BASC-3 documentation stack.',

        body: [
          'Sunshine Health\'s own newsroom describes Centene\'s Florida footprint as spanning several separate lines of business: "Sunshine Health offers government-sponsored managed care through Medicaid, Long Term Care, the Health Insurance Marketplace (Ambetter), and Medicare (Allwell)." Ambetter from Sunshine Health is the ACA Health Insurance Marketplace (exchange) brand — a completely different product from the Sunshine Health Medicaid MMA plan covered by the rest of this guide, underwritten by a separate entity (Centene Venture Company Florida / Sunshine State Health Plan, Inc. as a Qualified Health Plan issuer). Because roughly a quarter of Carelu\'s Florida intake mentions "Sunshine" or "Ambetter," and families often use the names interchangeably, intake should always ask which card the family actually holds rather than assuming Medicaid rules apply.',
          'The distinction isn\'t just branding — it changes which coverage rules govern. Florida\'s autism mandate (the Steven A. Geller Autism Coverage Act, § 627.6686, Fla. Stat.) explicitly excludes individual-market plans by its own text: the statute\'s definition of "health insurance plan" states it "does not include any health insurance plan offered in the individual market, any health insurance plan that is individually underwritten, or any health insurance plan provided to a small employer." Florida\'s own Office of Insurance Regulation confirms the practical effect: the mandate "appl[ies] to Florida regulated, fully-insured large group health insurance and Health Maintenance Organization plans," while "the regulation of coverage and benefits for ASD under individual and small group health plans" falls instead under the federal Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (MHPAEA) — and OIR notes MHPAEA "does not explicitly mandate applied behavior analysis (ABA) therapy as outlined in Florida law for large group plans." Ambetter marketplace plans are individual-market fully-insured products, so they sit outside the Geller Act entirely — a materially different, and more fragile, legal basis for ABA coverage than Florida Medicaid\'s AHCA-mandated Behavior Analysis benefit. Ambetter\'s own ABA coverage instead rests on ACA Essential Health Benefits/plan design and Centene\'s corporate-wide medical-necessity clinical policy (CP.BH.104, "Applied Behavior Analysis"), which explicitly carves out that Medicaid state rules take precedence over its own general criteria wherever the two conflict — confirming Ambetter is not simply a rebrand of the Medicaid benefit. We could not verify whether Ambetter\'s prior-authorization contacts are genuinely separate from Sunshine Health Medicaid\'s (the same portal, phone, and BH fax numbers appear on Ambetter\'s own published provider pages), so route by the family\'s actual card and plan documents rather than assuming a distinct process.',

          'The Steven A.

It explicitly excludes individual-market, individually underwritten, and small-employer plans. The eligible individual is narrow: under 18 (or 18 and older but still in high school) AND diagnosed with a developmental disability at 8 years of age or younger. Covered services include well-child ASD screening plus speech, OT, PT, and applied behavior analysis — and unusually for a state mandate, it covers treatment of Down syndrome as well as ASD. ABA benefits cap at $36,000 annually and $200,000 lifetime, with an annual CPI-medical adjustment; ABA providers must be certified under s. 393.17, Fla. Stat. or licensed under chapters 490/491. Self-funded ERISA plans sit outside state reach, and MHPAEA\'s ban on dollar-value treatment limits arguably neuters the caps for parity-subject plans. Florida DFS consumer guidance notes individual and small-group plans generally cover ABA via the ACA EHB benchmark plus parity even though the mandate doesn\'t reach them.',

    intro: [
      'Utah Medicaid covers ABA through its state-plan Autism Spectrum Disorder services — and the single most important structural fact is that ABA is a fee-for-service carve-out. Utah runs four physical-health ACOs (Health Choice Utah, Healthy U, Molina, SelectHealth Community Care), but ABA never touches them: diagnosis documentation, prior authorization, and claims all go directly to Utah Medicaid, whatever card the family carries. Layer on no PA for assessments, a 10-business-day retroactive PA grace period, coverage regardless of age, and a published fee schedule, and Utah is one of the most intake-friendly Medicaid programs in our directory. One transparency note: parts of this guide rest on the archived July 2023 ASD manual corroborated against the live PRISM coverage lookup; the January 2026 manual has since been verified directly (cited in the staffing section below) — where editions conflict, the newer manual governs.',

The manual states that mental health evaluations and psychological testing for diagnosing developmental disorders are carved out of the managed-care entities and reimbursed fee-for-service, and the state\'s own family-facing FAQ confirms that ABA PA requests go to the Medicaid agency and providers bill Medicaid directly.

No,\' limited to one assessment per 26 weeks at up to 24 units, with reassessment roughly every 6 months. So with a diagnosis in hand, intake can book and bill the assessment immediately.',
          'Treatment codes (97153, 97155, 97156, group codes, H0032) do need PA, submitted to the state PA unit through the PRISM portal on the ABA Services Prior Authorization Form, in 26-week authorization periods. Utah then adds a rare cushion: a 10-business-day grace period to submit the PA after starting services — initial and recertification alike — so a completed assessment can flow straight into treatment without an authorization gap. Miss the window and the authorization starts on the completed-submission date instead, so treat day one of treatment as the PA clock. The initial packet is substantial: the PA form, a copy of the written ASD diagnosis with the completed diagnostic tool, an order or prescription for ABA (renewed annually), and a treatment plan with assessment-tool copies, baseline data, measurable goals, weekly service amounts by code, and settings including telehealth hours. Reauthorization adds progress-versus-baseline data using the same measurement method, and requests above the maximum allowed units go to secondary medical review.',

          'Two eligibility facts set Utah apart. First, ASD services are available \'regardless of age\' — PRISM shows allowed ages 1 and older with adult plans included, so adults with ASD can get ABA, which almost no state Medicaid program offers. Second, third-party liability is enforced: commercial insurance must be exhausted first, and if the provider isn\'t paneled with the member\'s private plan and no out-of-network benefit exists, a transition (or enrollment with the insurer) must occur within 6 months of discovering the coverage — so ask about other insurance at intake, not at the first denied claim. Also worth flagging: telehealth works for supervision and parent training but not for technician-delivered 97153/97154 or group 97158, and school-based ABA on an IEP routes through the School-Based Skills Development benefit instead of FFS.',

        body: [
          'Per the July 2026 Medicaid Information Bulletin (item 26-61), Utah has reclassified ABA providers as \'High Risk\' for enrollment screening. Every existing ABA provider must revalidate within 18 months, with notices phased starting September 2026 — and revalidation now includes individual ownership reporting and fingerprint-based background checks. Failure to complete within 60 days of your notice risks enrollment closure, which would stop FFS claims cold, so treat the notice as a drop-everything item when it arrives. The same MIB (item 26-83) reconfirmed that group codes still require group-size modifiers (UN/UP/UQ/UR/US) or claims deny — and states explicitly that ABA modifier policy "will remain the same" under the new screening regime. As of this review the July 2026 MIB is confirmed still current (re-fetched directly; no amendment or delay language found), and a September 2026 MIB does not yet exist, so the phased-notice mailing itself can\'t yet be confirmed as underway — only that the policy as written remains in force. One adjacent item worth knowing: the same July 2026 MIB\'s item 26-62 is a separate, broader initiative — High-Risk billing providers generally (a category that now includes ABA per 26-61) get revalidation letters starting July 15, 2026 with a 90-day completion window, distinct from 26-61\'s September-phased/60-day timeline — so a provider could see either clock start depending on which notice arrives first. Sourcing note: the January 2026 ASD manual is verified and cited in this guide; the state lists a further 04/13/2026 update whose PDF was not retrievable at review time — where a determination hinges on the newest manual language, confirm with the PA unit (dmhfmedicalpolicy@utah.gov). Separately, an older-looking "Accessing ASD Services FAQ" (v2, dated 7/15/24) still live on medicaid.utah.gov states eligibility as "under 21" and CHEC/EPSDT-only — directly contradicting the regardless-of-age claim above, which rests on the stronger PRISM eligibility lookup and the ASD Related Services program page. Treat that FAQ as stale rather than authoritative, but confirm adult eligibility case-by-case in PRISM until the state reconciles the two documents.',

          'The January 2026 ASD manual update removed the technician on-ramp: behavior technicians must be fully certified before performing any services for a Utah Medicaid member — the manual states there is \'no grace period granted between a technician\'s initial hire date and the date in which the technician receives certification,\' ending the prior policy that allowed a 40-hour training plus competency assessment within 120 days of hire. Utah accepts technician certification from any NCCA-accredited body, naming the BACB (RBT), QABA, and BICC as examples, and the current certificate is submitted to Medicaid as part of provider enrollment. That changes the hiring math: an uncertified hire cannot touch a Medicaid caseload while training. The BACB floor beneath the RBT credential: age 18+, high-school education, a criminal background check and an abuse registry check — both confirmed by an attesting certificant no more than 180 days before the RBT application — the 40-hour training, the exam, and ongoing supervision of at least 5% of behavior-analytic service hours each calendar month.',
          'Utah runs no separate state background check on ABA technicians — the criminal and abuse-registry screening rides entirely on the required national certification. The state\'s screening energy points at owners instead. Effective July 1, 2026, MIB item 26-61 reclassified ABA providers to the \'High Risk\' screening category (Utah invoked 42 CFR 455.450(e) on May 1, 2026, citing national fraud trends). Every existing ABA provider must revalidate within 18 months; notices mail in phases beginning September 2026, and the screening must be completed within 60 days of the notice date or enrollment closes. High-Risk screening means: reporting every individual or corporation with a 5%-or-greater direct or indirect ownership interest; FBI fingerprint-based criminal background checks for those 5%+ individual owners (via FBI channelers); unannounced pre- or post-enrollment site visits; and the $750 federally mandated 2026 enrollment fee — waived only with proof of active enrollment and fee payment to Medicare or another state\'s Medicaid program. DHHS has committed to CMS to screen 4,644 high-risk billing providers by June 2028, so this wave will reach every ABA agency; have ownership disclosures, licenses, and certifications current and uploadable in PRISM before your letter arrives.',
          'On the supervisor side, practicing behavior analysis requires a Utah license under the Behavior Analyst Licensing Act (Utah Code Title 58, Chapter 61, Part 7): behavior analyst (LBA) — current good-standing BCBA certification qualifies outright, or a master\'s/doctorate plus 1,500 supervised hours and the exam — and assistant behavior analyst (LaBA), and the ASD manual requires supervising BCBAs and BCBA-Ds to hold the Utah license. Rule R156-61a adds a written supervision contract with per-meeting documentation and makes supervising without one unprofessional conduct. The Medicaid ratio that binds staffing: the QHP must supervise at least 10% of the time a member receives direct services from a technician or assistant analyst, at least 50% of it direct supervision — an additional 10% of direct supervision can be prior-authorized with documented medical necessity — and remote supervision counts only via synchronous two-way audio/video. Services by a \'behavior analyst in training\' (enrolled in a BACB-approved course sequence) are also billable under the licensure exemptions in Utah Code 58-61-707(10)–(12) when supervised by a psychologist or behavior analyst. And because ABA is a FFS carve-out, none of the four ACOs credential or screen ABA staff — certification, licensure, and the new High-Risk screening all run through state enrollment in PRISM. One unverified item: DOPL\'s behavior-analyst application page (which carries license fees) blocks automated retrieval, so confirm current licensing fees with DOPL directly.',

      'A family saying "we have Select Health" in Utah could mean two structurally different things, and getting it right changes where the ABA request goes. SelectHealth Community Care is one of Utah Medicaid\'s four ACOs (alongside Health Choice Utah, Healthy U, and Molina) — and Utah Medicaid carves ABA out of every ACO to state fee-for-service, so a Community Care member\'s ABA request never touches Select Health at all; it goes straight to Utah Medicaid, exactly as our Utah Medicaid guide describes. Select Health also separately sells commercial insurance — employer group and individual/marketplace plans, branded simply "Select Health" — and for those members, Select Health runs its own ABA clinical policy, its own prior-authorization form, and its own utilization-management team. Select Health (the parent brand) is a wholly owned subsidiary of Intermountain Health. This guide covers both paths.',

Select Health\'s own published carved-out-services list names mental-health medications, emergency transportation, long-term care, apnea monitors, and dental — it doesn\'t explicitly name ABA/autism services, so treat the FFS routing as inherited from Utah Medicaid\'s own carve-out policy (already verified in our Utah Medicaid guide) rather than a Select Health-authored statement.

For plans entered or renewed on or after January 1, 2020 there is no age limit and no cap on covered ABA hours; the older 600-hours-a-year floor and the ages-2-to-under-10 window govern only legacy pre-2020 plans. The statute has operational teeth, too: the treatment plan is due to the insurer within 14 business days of starting treatment, the insurer may review it at most once every 3 months, and plan networks must include both board certified behavior analysts and qualified licensed mental health providers. Its diagnosis definition is strict — a board-certified neurologist, psychiatrist, or pediatrician with ASD experience, or an experienced licensed psychologist. Self-funded ERISA plans are exempt by federal preemption, and MHPAEA supplies the parity floor for group plans. New from the 2026 amendment: beginning before July 1, 2027, every health benefit plan must report autism-assessment wait times, whether it imposes PA on assessment or treatment, and ABA utilization to the Utah Insurance Department annually — with public website disclosure of which plans reimburse non-physician therapists from September 1, 2027.

    intro: [
      'Health First Colorado covers ABA for members age 20 and younger through the Pediatric Behavioral Therapies (PBT) EPSDT benefit — and it breaks the usual state-Medicaid mold twice. First, no autism diagnosis is required: the coverage criteria open the benefit on any of three pathways (a qualifying condition including but not limited to ASD, a functional interference with home/school/community life, or a safety risk), so intake should never turn a family away for lacking an ASD evaluation. Second, ABA is a statewide fee-for-service carve-out: Colorado\'s four Regional Accountable Entities administer the capitated behavioral health benefit, but PBT is not in that capitation — every PAR goes to the state\'s UM vendor Acentra, and every claim goes to the state fiscal agent, regardless of the member\'s RAE. The trade-off is authorization rigor: everything, including the initial assessment, is prior-authorized, and 97156 parent-training does not exist as a billable code here.',

Approved PARs run up to six months, so reauthorization is a twice-a-year event: each new PAR needs documented meaningful, measurable, functional improvement "confirmed through data, documented in charts and graphs, durable over time," plus a signed revised treatment plan showing generalization outside the treatment setting. Documentation must meet CASP minimum requirements, and denials have four paths — PAR Reconsideration (second review by a different physician), a new PAR with added information, peer-to-peer, or member appeal to the Office of Administrative Courts.',

          'Colorado\'s fee schedule has three quirks intake and billing must both know. First, 97151 pays a FLAT amount per assessment — $882.78 on the July 2025 schedule, billable once per 365 days — rather than per 15-minute unit (97151-TJ pays $40.24/unit, set at 2 units per 365 days). Second, 97156 does not exist here: the family adaptive behavior treatment guidance code is absent from the PBT allowable-code table (97151, 97151-TJ, 97153, 97154, 97155, 97158 only) and has no rate — caregiver training is instead a required element woven into the treatment plan, not separately billable revenue. Third, rates were cut mid-year: Special Provider Bulletin B2500528 (September 2025, under Executive Order D 2025 014\'s budget shortfall) reduced PBT rates for dates of service on or after October 1, 2025 — 97153 $18.17 → $17.20 and 97155 $26.62 → $25.80 per 15-minute unit, with the group codes hit hardest: 97154 $11.51 → $8.81 (-23%) and 97158 $17.83 → $9.34 (-48%). There are no credential-tier modifiers — a single rate per code (TJ modifier only on 97151). As of this review, no restoration has landed: HCPF\'s July 1, 2026 fee schedule carries the identical post-cut PBT rates, unchanged from January and April 2026 — and while a new 2.0% across-the-board Health First Colorado rate cut took effect July 1, 2026 under HB 26-1410\'s FY2026-27 budget, HCPF\'s own provider-news page confirms Pediatric Behavioral Therapy is explicitly exempted from that additional cut.

          'Colorado turned technician credentialing into a billing condition in late 2025. Emergency rule MSB 25-09-04-A created Section 8.281 (emergency effective October 10, 2025; finally adopted December 12, 2025) after federal audit findings that uncredentialed technicians had been reimbursed — preliminary estimates put the potential repayment to CMS as high as $59 million. The rule requires billing providers to ensure every technician they supervise holds an active credential: an RBT (high school diploma, 40-hour BACB-specification training, passed competency exam, ongoing supervision per BACB requirements) or the QABA alternative, an ABAT (age 18+, high school diploma, 40 hours of approved coursework plus 15+ supervised hours, a 5% quarterly supervision requirement, passed competency exam). One honesty note on timing: the compliance deadline is currently suspended — HCPF\'s December 22, 2025 notice withdrew the December 12 deadline (which had itself replaced August 31) and promised a new date, while urging providers to reach full compliance now. Colorado has no state registry or license for technicians, so the requirement rides directly on the national certifications — and the BACB\'s own application already requires a criminal background check plus an abuse-registry check within 180 days of applying (the BACB does not require fingerprinting). For hiring pipelines, HB26-1425 (signed June 2, 2026) adds a one-time 45-day pre-certification billing window: Medicaid must reimburse for a not-yet-certified technician for at least 45 days while certification is pursued, but only after the tech clears a name-based judicial record check, completes all certification training, and completes abuse-and-neglect reporting training — the 45-day clock starts when those are done, the agency must submit quarterly technician rosters, and reimbursement requests must stop if certification isn\'t in hand by day 45. The law also protects titles: only techs holding a current, valid credential may be called "Registered Behavior Technician."',
          'Background screening now runs on three layers. Agency layer: Section 8.281.4 requires billing providers to complete ANNUAL background checks on every service provider they supervise — an ongoing employer obligation, not a hire-once event. Enrollment layer: HCPF\'s standard 42 CFR 455.434 screening imposes fingerprint-based checks on provider types designated high categorical risk and on any person with a 5%+ ownership or control interest in such a provider (the CY2026 federal institutional application fee is $750) — HCPF doesn\'t publish the risk category assigned to PBT Provider Types 83/84, so confirm whether enrollment-level fingerprinting applies with provider enrollment directly. Facility layer, center-based programs only: HB26-1425 makes ABA clinics CDHS-licensed day treatment facilities — license applications are due on or before August 1, 2026, and operating unlicensed becomes illegal August 1, 2027 — and the CDHS regime requires fingerprint-based CBI-plus-FBI checks on every applicant, owner, employee, newly hired employee, licensee, and adult 18+ residing in the clinic, screened against the C.R.S. 26-6-905(8) disqualifying offenses, plus a TRAILS check for confirmed child abuse or neglect findings; every new hire triggers a fresh investigation (with a portability exception for commonly owned clinics on a central records system). ABA delivered in homes, schools, or community settings is exempt from clinic licensure (C.R.S. 26-6-904(1)(e)), so this regime binds center-based operations only.',
          'On the supervisor side, Colorado has no behavior analyst license in force today — Medicaid qualifies billing providers through the Behavioral Therapy Provider Attestation (rev. September 2025), whose four tiers run from licensed doctoral clinicians down to BCBA/QASP certification, and Section 8.281.4 requires an approved attestation plus a clean record (no sanctions or discipline from the applicable licensing board or credentialing body), with asynchronous supervision explicitly non-covered. Under HB26-1425\'s Medicaid provisions, a reimbursable RBT must work under the supervision of a licensed psychologist, BCBA, BCBA-D, or BCaBA, and Section 8.281 imports the BACB floor — supervision on a minimum of 5% of service hours each calendar month — as a Medicaid condition. The licensure horizon: on July 1, 2028, mandatory state licensure arrives under a new Colorado Behavior Analyst Licensing Board in DORA — Licensed Behavior Analysts (BCBA, BCBA-D, or QBA certification plus a fingerprint-based CBI/FBI check at the applicant\'s cost) and Licensed Assistant Behavior Analysts (BCaBA or QASP-S, practicing only under LBA supervision) — with unlicensed practice a class 2 misdemeanor. The supervision ratio is left to board rulemaking (no numeric caseload cap in statute yet), so build the 2028 conversion into your credentialing roadmap now.',

    intro: [
      'Anthem in Colorado is Rocky Mountain Hospital and Medical Service, Inc., with HMO products underwritten by HMO Colorado, Inc. Three things make Colorado different from the rest of Anthem\'s footprint, and all three are worth knowing before the first authorization goes out: Anthem publishes a Colorado-specific ABA provider resource guide rather than folding the state into its multi-state one; Colorado\'s autism mandate lost its dollar caps years ago and never had a small-group carve-out; and since March 1, 2026 Anthem authorizes ABA in weekly approved units, so a claim that exceeds the weekly number gets adjusted even when the total authorization still has room.',
      'As always, plan funding type is the first fact to establish. Colorado\'s mandate binds health benefit plans issued or renewed in the state; self-funded ERISA plans are outside state insurance law entirely and answer to federal parity instead. Anthem\'s own Colorado precertification list says as much in its scope note — it applies to local fully-insured members and only to those self-insured (ASO) members whose group purchased the medical-management program.',

Second, there is no small-employer exemption anywhere in subsection (1.4) — the only carve-outs written into the definition of "health benefit plan" for this subsection are short-term limited-duration policies and individual grandfathered plans.

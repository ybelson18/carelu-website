At the fee-for-service layer, administered through eMedNY, there is no prior authorization at all: the entire front door is a practitioner referral valid for up to two years. But since January 1, 2023 the benefit is carved into every mainstream Medicaid Managed Care plan, most children sit in one of those ~13 plans, and every major plan does impose its own prior authorization.

The gate is a referral from a NYS-licensed and NYS Medicaid-enrolled physician, psychologist, psychiatric nurse practitioner, pediatric nurse practitioner, or physician assistant (LBAs cannot diagnose or self-refer). The referral is valid for no more than 2 years and must carry a specific payload: the member\'s age, the ASD and/or Rett diagnosis with date of initial diagnosis, co-morbid diagnoses, severity level, a statement of need for ABA, and the DSM-5 Diagnostic Checklist. Once services start, the treatment plan must be updated at least every 6 months and shared with the referring provider. For intake, that means a complete referral packet is the whole authorization battle on FFS — chase its required elements at first contact, because an incomplete referral is the only thing standing between the family and a booked assessment.',
          'One forward-looking caveat: the Governor\'s FY 2026-27 Executive Budget proposed an ABA "Centers of Excellence" (CoE) designation framework whose criteria were still undefined as of mid-2026. Two budget-summary sources on the enacted SFY2026-27 budget (signed 5/28/2026) describe only the ABA rate-methodology reform as surviving into the enacted budget, with no CoE program mentioned — but that read comes from secondary budget-highlights write-ups, not primary bill text, so treat "CoE didn\'t survive" as unconfirmed rather than settled.

The state\'s own manual is blunt about what that means: providers serving an MMC member "must contact the MMC member\'s specific MMC plan for coverage, billing, and reimbursement guidance." Unlike the FFS layer, every major plan imposes prior authorization, each with its own machinery — Fidelis\'s Centene-style clinical policy, UnitedHealthcare\'s Optum portal, Anthem\'s Availity form, Healthfirst, MetroPlus, EmblemHealth, and Molina all have dedicated guides below.',

Per the state\'s July 2026 Medicaid Managed Care enrollment report, the five regional plans carry real scale, not a rounding error: Excellus (179,533 statewide members), MVP (165,151), CDPHP (80,854), Independent Health (60,812, Erie County only), and Highmark Western & Northeastern NY (45,881) — roughly 532,000 members combined.

Other operational rules worth wiring into intake: ABA is not reimbursable in a school setting (home, clinic, and community are fine); records must be kept at least 6 years and, for minors, until the patient turns 22 (10 years for MMC providers); and ABA-via-telehealth was under formal state evidence review in mid-2025 — supervision of technicians may already occur via synchronous audio/video.',

          'New York has no RBT mandate. The FFS manual defines the technician tier simply as an "unlicensed individual" — someone not licensed, certified, or registered by the state as an ABA provider — with no credential, training-hour, age, or education requirement attached. What the state regulates instead is scope: an LBA may not delegate any task within the ABA scope of practice, even under direct supervision, so technicians only execute the scripted treatment-plan activities the LBA wrote, record data without interpreting it, prepare the setting, and write factual session notes. The middle tier is unique to New York: the Certified Behavior Analyst Assistant (CBAA), a NYSED credential under Education Law Article 167 requiring a bachelor\'s degree (in ABA, or a related field plus ABA certificate coursework), 1,000 hours of supervised experience, and passage of both the NYCBAA and NY Autism exams. And if you staff with RBTs anyway — many agencies do — the BACB\'s own floor travels with the credential: 18+, high-school education, the 40-hour training and competency assessment, and a passed criminal background check plus abuse-registry check no more than 180 days before the certification application.',
          'On background screening, the ABA Policy Manual itself imposes no employee-level background-check, fingerprinting, or registry requirement — the obligations arrive from adjacent rules, keyed to what your agency is. At provider enrollment, NY Medicaid screens applications at the federal limited/moderate/high risk tiers and collects the $750 federal application fee (2026) from certain provider types (waived if already paid to Medicare or another state\'s Medicaid/CHIP within 12 months); enrollment fingerprinting attaches only at the high-risk tier, so confirm your risk category with provider enrollment. Justice Center pre-employment checks — Staff Exclusion List check first, then a fingerprint-based criminal background check via IdentoGO, fully completed before the hire has regular unsupervised contact with recipients — bind programs under Justice Center jurisdiction (OMH- and OPWDD-operated/certified programs, OCFS residential programs for children), not a standalone LBA practice billing Medicaid FFS; but an agency that also runs OPWDD-certified services (e.g., community habilitation) carries the full four-check stack: SEL, CBC, an MHL 16.34 check, and the OCFS child-abuse SCR check. Every agency, whatever its settings, should screen staff against the three exclusion databases OMIG names — the NYS Medicaid exclusion list, the federal OIG LEIE, and SAM.gov; OMIG doesn\'t publish a check frequency, so set a recurring cadence in your compliance plan.',
          'The supervisor credential is the LBA, and New York is explicit that BCBA certification alone "is not sufficient" to practice — it\'s only a pathway to licensure, which requires a master\'s from a NYSED-registered ABA program (or substantial equivalent), the exam (BCBA satisfies it), supervised experience, good moral character, minimum age 21, NYSED-approved child-abuse-reporting coursework, and a $300 fee. The supervision math covered above — 5% of each technician\'s monthly service hours, two face-to-face contacts, the six-supervisee cap — is what turns those credentials into a staffing model. Plans then layer on their own stacks: Optum/UHC Community Plan requires network LBAs to hold active BCBA certification plus the NY license plus a NY Medicaid ID (CBAAs need their own Medicaid ID), along with professional liability insurance and a virtual-visits attestation for telehealth supervision; Healthfirst stretches record retention to 10 years for MMC providers (vs. the state\'s 6-year/age-22 floor). No NY Medicaid plan we checked requires RBT certification for technicians.',

Three features define it. No age limit: unlike Medicaid\'s under-21 rule, neither the statute nor CL 6 sets one, so adult ABA cases are mandate-covered on fully-insured plans. An hours cap, not dollars: ABA may be limited to 680 hours per policy or calendar year per covered individual — the old $45,000 figure still cited in blogs is not in the current guidance, so track authorization requests against an hours budget (680 hours ≈ 13 hrs/week year-round; comprehensive-intensity programs can exhaust it mid-year). And a credential gate: since October 11, 2014, mandated ABA must be provided or supervised by NYSED-licensed LBAs or CBAAs — BACB certification alone doesn\'t satisfy it. Self-funded ERISA plans sit outside the mandate by preemption; MHPAEA parity applies to ABA as a behavioral health benefit either way.

The rigor arrives at the treatment step, which requires the completed assessment plus a treatment plan with Cigna\'s ABA PA form. Unlike Virginia, New York gets no carve-out from EN0499 — the current policy names New York only as an example of a state mandate ("New York law requires regulated benefit plans to provide coverage for the screening, diagnosis and treatment of ASD, including applied behavioral analysis"), so the national criteria apply to New York business, fully-insured and self-funded alike. What changes in New York is the legal floor underneath: the state mandate below governs what fully-insured plans must cover, while self-funded employer plans answer to ERISA and federal parity instead. Plan funding type is therefore the first fact to establish on every benefits check.

An hours cap, not dollars: ABA may be limited to 680 hours per policy or calendar year per covered individual — the old $45,000 figure still cited in blogs is not in the current guidance, so track authorization requests against an hours budget (680 hours ≈ 13 hrs/week year-round; comprehensive-intensity programs can exhaust it mid-year).

      'Independent Health Association runs NY Medicaid Managed Care under the brand "MediSource" (HARP: MediSource Connect), covering 60,812 members per the state\'s July 2026 enrollment report — all of them in Erie County, the Buffalo market; the state\'s own enrollment tables do not list Independent Health under Monroe County, so treat this as a Buffalo/Erie plan rather than a Buffalo-and-Rochester one. Independent Health delegates behavioral health benefit management for its state products to Carelon Behavioral Health — but the evidence points to ABA sitting outside that delegation: the current MediSource member handbook places its ABA section apart from the "Behavioral Health Care" section that carries Carelon\'s crisis-line branding throughout, describing ABA in "Independent Health covers..." language instead. That distinction isn\'t stated explicitly in a single provider-facing sentence we could find, so this guide treats it as strongly indicated rather than certain, and flags it as the first thing to confirm on any Independent Health case.',

But the 2026 MediSource Member Handbook places its "Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) Services" description in a separate part of the document — grouped with Children\'s HCBS and Article 29-I VFCA services rather than the "Behavioral Health Care" (mental health/substance use) section — and describes it in "Independent Health covers..." and "Independent Health will work with you and your provider" language, with no Carelon reference anywhere in that section, while every page of the Behavioral Health Care section footers Carelon\'s crisis line. That placement is consistent with New York\'s statewide pattern of no BH-vendor carve-out for the mainstream MMC ABA benefit — but because no single sentence confirms it plainly, verify with Provider Services which entity (Independent Health or Carelon) actually adjudicates ABA authorizations and claims before routing a case to either one.',

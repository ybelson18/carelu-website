      'Kansas Medicaid doesn\'t call it ABA. Since January 1, 2017, the benefit lives in the State Plan under EPSDT as two "Autism Services": Consultative Clinical and Therapeutic Services (CCTS) — the BCBA-level tier covering assessment, treatment planning, supervision, and family training — and Intensive Individual Supports (IIS), the technician-level 1:1 tier. Understanding that vocabulary is half the intake battle, because authorizations, provider enrollment, and limits are all organized around the CCTS/IIS split. Delivery runs entirely through KanCare\'s managed care organizations — Sunflower Health Plan, UnitedHealthcare Community Plan, and (since January 1, 2025) Healthy Blue Kansas — with KMAP fee-for-service policy as the baseline underneath. Aetna Better Health of Kansas is gone: it lost the KanCare 3.0 contract and its members moved to Healthy Blue on 1/1/2025.',

But the credentialing bottleneck to plan around is KMAP enrollment: every group AND every individual provider — each BCBA and each RBT — must be screened and enrolled in KMAP with their own KMAP ID before any MCO can pay them, and each service location requires separate enrollment.',

The tripwire to design intake around is diagnosis recency: both Sunflower (KS.CP.01) and Optum/UHC (BH 803ABA Kansas entry) require that an MD or licensed psychologist has validated the ASD diagnosis via comprehensive diagnostic evaluation within the last 6 months at initial authorization — an unusually aggressive rule that means a two-year-old diagnostic report doesn\'t clear the gate.

          'Kansas is one of the few states where RBT certification is genuinely optional for Medicaid work. Since April 3, 2020, IIS technicians (KMAP type 11, specialty 404, billing 97153) qualify one of two ways: hold an RBT certificate, or complete the state-equivalent pathway — age 18+, high-school diploma or equivalent, 40 hours of ABA training including 8 hours of supervised intervention work and 3 hours of ethics (plus at least 1 hour each in criterion-referenced assessment, social skills, parent training, and program development), an initial competency assessment, and an acceptance letter from the KDADS HCBS Autism Program Manager or HCBS Director. That letter is individually issued, so it adds onboarding lead time; either track requires annual training to stay qualified. Technicians don\'t need a BSRB license — K.S.A. 65-7503 expressly exempts autism specialists and IIS providers under the state autism program from behavior analyst licensure. If you hire on the RBT track, the BACB\'s own floor still applies: the 40-hour training completed over 5–180 days, a competency assessment within 90 days of applying, and both a criminal background check and an abuse-registry check passed within 180 days of application payment.',
          'The state layer is a five-part enrollment screening package. Under the same April 2020 policy, every individually enrolling CCTS and IIS applicant must demonstrate a clean background across checks of Kansas Bureau of Investigation (KBI) records, the Adult Protective Services and Child Protective Services registries, the Nurse Aide Registry, and a motor-vehicle screen — that last one is a Kansas oddity, so collect driving records at onboarding. The bulletins don\'t publish a re-check cadence, and the KMAP HCBS Autism manual (which reportedly also requires proof of background checks and insurance at enrollment) sits on a portal we couldn\'t reach during research — confirm current screening details with KMAP provider enrollment directly. Layer federal exclusion screening on top regardless: check every hire against the HHS-OIG LEIE (and SAM.gov) at hire and monthly, since employing an excluded individual draws civil monetary penalties.',
          'At the supervisor tier, licensure has been mandatory since July 1, 2016: practicing ABA in Kansas requires a Licensed Behavior Analyst — or a Licensed Assistant Behavior Analyst under LBA supervision — through the Behavioral Sciences Regulatory Board under K.S.A. 65-7501 et seq. CCTS enrollment (type 11, specialty 403) takes a BSRB-licensed BCBA, BCBA-D, or BCaBA, or — another Kansas-specific alternative — a master\'s-level professional with documented ASD experience, state-approved training, and a KDADS letter. IIS technicians must work under the direction of a BCBA or qualified CCTS practitioner, but no Kansas-specific observation percentage or tech-per-supervisor ratio appears in any accessible primary source — for RBT-certified staff, the BACB\'s 5%-of-hours monthly supervision minimum (two face-to-face contacts per month, one individual, one observing service delivery) is the operative floor. The BSRB\'s own site was unreachable during our research, so confirm renewal and CE specifics with the board. Plan-level, Optum/UHC adds the real extras: KanCare ABA providers must hold a KMAP ID, carry $1M-per-occurrence / $1M-aggregate professional liability coverage, and contract separately with Optum\'s Kansas ABA network — and KMAP itself warns that MCO implementation dates can lag state policy, so verify each MCO\'s rollout individually. The MCO documents we reviewed add no staff-level background checks beyond the state baseline.',

      { q: 'Does UnitedHealthcare cover ABA therapy in Kansas?', a: 'Yes — under Optum\'s national two-step authorization policy for ASD, layered on Kansas\'s mandate (K.S.A. 40-2,194) for fully-insured large-group plans. Self-funded employer plans are exempt from the mandate, so always verify plan funding type first.' },
      { q: 'What does the Kansas autism mandate require?', a: 'For large-group (51+) fully-insured plans: coverage for members under 12, with ABA capped at 1,300 hours/year for 4 years when diagnosed by age 5, otherwise 520 hours/year — exceedable with prior approval when medically necessary. Federal parity analysis questions the age limit and hour caps, so treat cap denials as appealable.' },
      { q: 'Does Optum have Kansas-specific ABA criteria?', a: 'Yes, but only for Medicaid: its State Mandates supplement carries a "For Kansas Medicaid member" section (KanCare CCTS/IIS rules). Commercial Kansas members follow the national Supplemental Clinical Criteria.' },
      { q: 'What does UnitedHealthcare pay for ABA in Kansas?', a: 'Commercial ABA rates are not published — they are negotiated in your participating-provider agreement. The Medicaid benchmark exists only via the KMAP interactive fee-schedule lookup.' },

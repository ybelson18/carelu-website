The clinical bar is specific: an ASD diagnosis supported by a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation (CDE) performed by a doctoral-level HSPP psychologist, physician, APRN, or PA; a physician referral; and a behavior assessment that must include the Vineland (with the Maladaptive Behavior domain), the BASC parent rating questionnaire, and an age-appropriate direct skills assessment, signed by the lead analyst and a parent. A CDE older than one year needs an updated statement of need, referral, and current behavior assessment. One tool-currency note: IHCP will accept either the BASC-3 Parent Rating Questionnaire or its successor, BASC-4 (public release expected ~August 23, 2026), through October 1, 2026 — after that date only BASC-4 satisfies the requirement.',

IHCP Bulletin BT2026136 (8/18/2026) clarifies that floor rather than raising or lowering the ceiling: the required minimum can be reduced below the standard 12-hour/6-month caregiver-coaching floor from BT202662 when documented barriers exist — custody or foster-care disruptions, medical crises, homelessness, legal restrictions, and similar circumstances — provided a caregiver-coaching "improvement plan" is documented at reauthorization whenever the minimum wasn\'t met.',

Also effective April 1, 2026: comprehensive ABA (16+ hours/week, billed with modifier UA) draws from a 4,000-hour (16,000-unit) lifetime allocation per member — 97155 and 97156 are excluded from the allocation, and the IHCP Portal\'s "Limit Details" panel shows usage — while targeted ABA is capped at 15 hours/week but exempt from the lifetime cap.

Missing either milestone results in enrollment deactivation, not just a warning. IHCP reissued this deadline as a reminder in Bulletin BT2026118 (7/14/2026) with no extension and sharper enforcement language: "Failure to provide documentation will result in the enrollment being deactivated." One footnote worth reading twice: BT202646 states a previous BHCOE accreditation is accepted only "until an agency\'s reaccreditation with ACQ," so agencies choosing an accreditor should plan the reaccreditation path, not just the first credential.',

HHS-OIG\'s own audit-report page confirms the moratorium follows an OIG finding of improperly paid Indiana ABA claims, though the IHCP bulletin itself doesn\'t name the audit. New or expanding ABA agencies should treat this moratorium, not just the accreditation deadline, as the binding constraint on growth in Indiana this year.',

          'Indiana is one of the few states where technicians enroll in Medicaid individually. Since December 18, 2024, RBTs enroll with the IHCP as rendering providers (provider type 11, specialty 625 — ABA Therapist RBT), and all RBTs and BCaBAs had to be individually enrolled by April 1, 2025 — each with their own Type 1 NPI, enrolled once and then associated with every group they render for. Since April 1, 2025 the rendering NPI on claims must align with the credential-level modifier (U1 RBT / U2 BCaBA / U3 BCBA-HSPP), though a bulletin update note delayed enforcement of that alignment. There is no separate state RBT license: IC 25-8.5-3-6 lets "direct contact technicians" practice without a license when implementing plans under the supervision and direction of a licensed behavior analyst, so the certification floor is the BACB\'s — age 18+, high-school education, the 40-hour training, competency assessment, and the RBT exam, plus the BACB\'s own requirement that every applicant pass a criminal background check and an abuse-registry check within 180 days before applying.',
          'On top of that, IHCP classifies all three ABA specialties (615 Masters/Doctoral-HSPP, 624 Bachelors, 625 RBT) as HIGH risk at enrollment — which triggers a fingerprint-based criminal background check for every individually enrolling RBT, BCaBA, and BCBA before the application can be completed. Fingerprints go through the Indiana State Police, the provider pays the fee, and results are sent to the FSSA (not the agency) for review; the check is specific to the individual, so an enrolled RBT joining a second group doesn\'t need a new one. Enrolled school corporations are exempt, but group providers rendering ABA in school settings are not, and specialty 615 group/billing enrollments additionally get a site visit. FSSA can deny enrollment for convictions it "determines is inconsistent with the best interest of IHCP members" — violent, financial, substance, abuse, and firearm offenses are the published examples. Build the fingerprint step into your hiring timeline: it sits between offer and first billable session.',
          'Supervisor-side, Indiana now licenses behavior analysts: LBA and LABA credentials under IC 25-8.5 (applications live May 13, 2025), with LBA licensure requiring current BCBA certification plus a national criminal history background check ($100 application; LABAs pay $75 and must file a signed supervision contract with a licensed behavior analyst). For IHCP enrollment, specialty 615 is limited to HSPP-licensed or BCBA/BCBA-D-certified providers, and the assessments feeding every PA may only be performed by a psychologist, BCBA-D, or master\'s-level BCBA. The binding ratio since April 1, 2026: at least 1 hour of BCBA (or IHCP-approved qualifying clinician) supervision per 8 hours of technician-delivered therapy — and with 97153 now in-person only, that supervision capacity has to exist where the sessions happen. These screening rules ride on IHCP enrollment across fee-for-service and the MCEs; we found no evidence the plans add employee-level checks beyond the state baseline, but current MCE provider manuals weren\'t exhaustively reviewed — confirm with each plan at credentialing.',

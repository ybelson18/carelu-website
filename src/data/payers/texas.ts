    intro: [
      'Texas Medicaid added ABA as a defined benefit on February 1, 2022 — "Autism Services" under the Texas Health Steps Comprehensive Care Program (THSteps-CCP), the state\'s EPSDT vehicle. It is one statewide rulebook: HHSC writes the medical-necessity criteria into the Texas Medicaid Provider Procedures Manual (TMPPM), and every delivery channel — fee-for-service through TMHP and all the STAR, STAR Kids, and STAR Health managed-care plans — applies the same criteria. The benefit covers ages birth through 20 (eligibility ends on the 21st birthday; CHIP is explicitly excluded), requires prior authorization on everything from the initial evaluation forward, and runs on a distinctive 90/90/180-day authorization cadence. The MCO guides below cover per-plan submission mechanics; the clinical rules on this page apply everywhere.',

The gate is an ASD diagnosis — but not any diagnosis, from anyone, at any time. The TMPPM requires the diagnosis to come from a developmental pediatrician, neurologist, psychiatrist, licensed psychologist, or an interdisciplinary team (a physician, PA, or NP in consultation with qualified child specialists with autism expertise), documented with DSM diagnostic criteria and a symptom severity level, and made or reconfirmed within the 3 years before the PA request. A diagnosis alone is not sufficient to establish medical necessity — the evaluation builds that case. For intake, the 3-year recency rule is the trap to screen for early: a child diagnosed at 2 who shows up at 7 needs a diagnostic reconfirmation before the PA can go in.',

          'Texas certifies behavior technicians but doesn\'t license them. The TMPPM (§ 2.3.6.3) requires every BT to hold one of three certifications — RBT, BCAT, or ABAT — so the RBT is accepted but explicitly not the only pathway. BTs may not enroll in Texas Medicaid (they render under the enrolled LBA), may not use "therapist" in their job title when interacting with Medicaid families, and may not conduct assessments or modify the treatment plan. There\'s no state license, registry, or training-hour add-on for BTs: Occupations Code § 506.054 exempts a person designated as a behavior technician from behavior analyst licensure when working under the authority and direction of an LBA or LaBA, so the certification requirement comes from Medicaid policy, not licensure law. For the RBT pathway, the BACB\'s own floor is what screens your hires: 18+, high-school education, a criminal background check and abuse-registry check no more than 180 days before applying, the 40-hour training, a competency assessment, and the exam.',
          'The agency-level screening that actually binds a standalone ABA practice is exclusion screening, not the long-term-care registries. As a condition of enrollment, all providers must screen every employee and contractor every month against both the federal HHS-OIG LEIE and the Texas HHSC-OIG exclusion list (TMPPM Vol. 1, § 1.3.1) — build this into payroll-cycle compliance, not just onboarding. The Employee Misconduct Registry, by contrast, applies only to the facility types listed in Health & Safety Code § 253.001 (nursing facilities, HCSSAs, assisted living, ICF/IID, and similar) — a standalone ABA agency isn\'t on that list, so EMR pre-hire checks aren\'t legally required unless you also hold one of those licenses. Fingerprinting is similarly narrow: it attaches at provider enrollment, only for high categorical-risk providers and owners with a 5%+ interest (via IdentoGO, with proof uploaded to PEMS within 30 days of application) — individually licensed behavior analysts are not designated high-risk. At the supervisor level, TDLR requires every LBA and LaBA applicant to pass a criminal history background check as a condition of licensure.',
          'Supervision structure follows enrollment structure. Only the LBA enrolls and bills; the LBA must directly employ or contract with every LaBA and BT on the team, and LaBAs can\'t practice independently — by statute they must be supervised by an LBA per their certifying body\'s requirements. The TMPPM makes LBAs the direct supervisors of LaBAs and BTs but sets no numeric ratio of its own, deferring to certifying-body minimums — which makes the BACB standard the operative floor for RBT-credentialed staff: supervision of at least 5% of service hours each month, with at least two face-to-face contacts per month (one observing service delivery, one individual). One billing wrinkle to plan around: only direct supervision — the LBA observing the LaBA or BT with the client — is reimbursable, under 97155; indirect supervision (caseload review, data discussion) is unpaid time. And BTs and LaBAs must deliver 1:1 treatment in person — no remote service delivery. MCOs mirror this baseline (Texas Children\'s Health Plan\'s autism guideline repeats it nearly verbatim), but only TCHP was checked in depth — confirm each MCO\'s provider manual for staff-level extras at contracting.',

    intro: [
      'Texas Children\'s Health Plan (TCHP) — the Houston-anchored plan serving STAR, STAR Kids, and CHIP in the Harris, Jefferson, and Northeast service areas — is the rare Texas MCO that wrote its own ABA document: the ~30-page Autism Services Guideline #11281, version 3. Read it closely and it\'s the TMPPM in a different binder — the same diagnoser list, 3-year recency rule, LBA/LaBA/BT role definitions, and BT restrictions, transcribed nearly verbatim — with TCHP\'s own UM process bolted on. That\'s good news operationally: nothing clinically new to learn, and a clearly documented submission path.',

Requests go to the UM Department via the electronic authorization portal, fax, phone, or mail; electronic signatures are accepted, with the paper process running by fax.

      'Driscoll Health Plan — the children\'s-hospital-affiliated plan serving STAR, STAR Kids, and CHIP across South Texas — administers the state ABA benefit with no distinct clinical policy: TMPPM criteria govern. Its operational profile is unusually low-friction for practices that already work statewide, because Driscoll uses the statewide Texas Authorization Referral Form (TARF) rather than a proprietary form, and it runs a public per-code PA lookup portal that answers "does this code need auth?" without a phone call.',

    intro: [
      'Community Health Choice (CHC) — the nonprofit Houston plan launched in 1997 by Harris Health System, serving STAR (Harris and Jefferson counties), STAR+PLUS, CHIP, and Marketplace lines — is one of the few Texas MCOs to publish its own dedicated ABA clinical document: a "Medical Review Guideline: Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA) Services," newly adopted by its Medical Care Management Committee in June 2026. Read closely, it is substantially a TMPPM restatement — same diagnoser list, 3-year recency rule, 8-hour daily cap — but CHC layers its own UM machinery on top: named frequency tiers, an explicit 85%-attendance threshold on extension requests, and a named list of excluded, non-ABA interventions. CHIP is excluded from the benefit, as it is statewide.',

The 6-hour/24-unit evaluation cap and 3-year diagnosis recency rule both match the statewide baseline.',

Build attendance tracking into practice workflow from day one at CHC, not just at the recert deadline. The guideline also names specific interventions it does not consider ABA and will not authorize under this benefit — DIR/Floortime, TEACCH, and RDI are called out explicitly — and excludes ABA delivered as school-setting shadowing, para-professional, or companion services, along with goals limited to academic content or "performative social norms" not tied to health or safety.',

      'Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas (BCBSTX), a Division of Health Care Service Corporation, runs STAR and STAR Kids in the Travis service area — distinct from BCBSTX\'s commercial and Federal Employee Program lines, which follow different rules entirely (see our BCBSTX commercial guide for those). BCBSTX publishes no dedicated Autism Services chapter in its combined STAR/CHIP/STAR Kids provider manual; ABA policy instead lives in a standalone PA checklist and a periodically updated PA procedure code grid. The operationally important fact for intake: BCBSTX carved Medicaid behavioral health out to Magellan as recently as mid-2023, then "insourced" it in 2024 — older documents referencing Magellan are stale.',

    intro: [
      'Cook Children\'s Health Plan — the pediatric-focused plan affiliated with Cook Children\'s Health Care System, serving STAR and STAR Kids across six North Texas counties (Wise, Denton, Parker, Tarrant, Hood, and Johnson) — publishes an unusually deep ABA provider-education footprint for a Texas MCO: a dedicated 123-page "Applied Behavior Analysis" training deck plus a separate acute-PA training covering ABA mechanics in detail. Read closely, it\'s a faithful restatement of TMPPM §2.3 rather than a distinct plan overlay — the value here is the clarity and depth of the restatement, not a different rulebook. We found no ABA process that differs between STAR and STAR Kids in the plan\'s own materials.',

    intro: [
      'Parkland Community Health Plan (PCHP) — a program of Dallas County Hospital District serving STAR, CHIP, and CHIP Perinate across seven North Texas counties (Dallas, Collin, Ellis, Hunt, Kaufman, Navarro, and Rockwall) — delivers the state Autism Services benefit for members ages 0–20 with an ASD diagnosis made or reconfirmed within 3 years, available on STAR only (CHIP is excluded, matching the statewide rule). The operational fact that matters most for intake right now: PCHP transitioned behavioral health administration away from the Carelon Behavioral Health network and brought it in-house, effective September 1, 2025 — providers who contracted with Carelon for Parkland\'s BH network had to re-contract directly with PCHP, and older Carelon-branded provider manuals for this plan are no longer current.',

    intro: [
      'El Paso Health — a nonprofit HMO established by the El Paso County Hospital District, rebranded from "El Paso First Health Plans" in 2017, serving STAR, CHIP, and STAR+PLUS across El Paso and Hudspeth counties — is one of the more document-rich Texas MCOs for ABA: a dedicated ABA Request Checklist and two 2026 provider memos spell out documentation requirements in more detail than most plans publish. One framing note: El Paso Health is the market\'s founding and longest-standing Medicaid plan, but is not the sole MCO in the El Paso service delivery area — secondary HHSC service-area sources indicate Molina and Superior also participate in STAR and/or CHIP there, so confirm current network participation for STAR+PLUS specifically rather than assuming exclusivity.',

Two provider memos dated 5/15/2026 add detail beyond the statewide baseline: attendance logs for both the child and the parent/caregiver are required with every extension/recert, and services fall below 85% attendance trigger a requirement for the LBA to document why and what corrective steps were taken. A separate memo specifies the ASD diagnostic evaluation must use a validated standardized tool — ADOS, ADI-R, or CARS are named — and that screening tools like the M-CHAT-R/F cannot substitute.',

Notably absent from that Medicaid-specific list: 97152, 97157, 0362T, and 0373T — those four codes appear only in FirstCare\'s separate commercial-oriented Medical Coverage Policy #206 ("Autism Spectrum Disorder"), which explicitly defers Medicaid decisions to the TMPPM: "For Medicaid plans, please confirm coverage as outlined in the Texas Medicaid Provider Procedures Manual." That same commercial policy confirms the Texas mandate\'s $36,000/year ABA cap for members 10+ "do not apply to self-funded/ERISA plans, Medicaid, or Medicare" — consistent with the statewide Medicaid baseline having no dollar cap.

      'Read this first: RightCare — Baylor Scott & White Health Plan\'s STAR Medicaid product for the Central Texas Medicaid Rural Service Area (MRSA Central) — is exiting the Texas Medicaid managed care program effective August 31, 2026, subject to regulatory approval. TMHP\'s own announcement and the plan\'s own site both confirm it. Its sister brand, FirstCare Health Plans (MRSA West/Lubbock), is exiting on the same date. For any family newly presenting with a RightCare STAR card, factor the wind-down into onboarding — a family\'s Medicaid managed-care assignment is likely to change soon regardless of what you do. For active RightCare cases, the plan\'s guidance is that prior-authorization processes remain unaffected during the transition, so keep following the process below through the exit date.',

The plan is affiliated with Dell Children\'s Medical Center and Ascension Seton (its provider manual and staff correspondence run through @seton.org and @ascension.org addresses), giving it a pediatric-hospital-system orientation. For ABA specifically, the plan delegates behavioral-health prior authorization to Magellan Healthcare rather than administering it in-house, and it publishes its own current PA code list confirming ABA as a covered STAR benefit.',

One discrepancy worth flagging rather than silently resolving: the same PA list also shows code 97157 with PA=Yes, even though 97157 is confirmed absent from Texas Medicaid\'s actual THSteps-CCP Autism Services billable code set per TMHP\'s own fee schedule and handbook — treat 97157\'s status with this plan as needing direct confirmation. Separately, the provider manual\'s STAR-covered-services list explicitly names ABA, but the CHIP-specific covered-behavioral-health-services bullet list in the same manual does not repeat ABA by name (it lists inpatient/outpatient mental health and substance-use-disorder services only) — this is genuinely ambiguous in the plan\'s own document, so confirm ABA coverage for standard CHIP (non-STAR, non-Perinatal) members directly with the plan rather than assuming either way.',

Code § 1355.015, enacted by HB 1919 in 2007 and expanded several times since — applies to group health benefit plans (group policies, HMOs, group hospital service contracts, and TRS school-employee plans), and it has a structure intake teams must internalize: coverage runs from the date of diagnosis, but only if the ASD diagnosis was in place before the child\'s 10th birthday. Once eligible, coverage continues — the statute sets no upper age cutoff on continuing benefits. Covered services are broad ("all generally recognized services": evaluation, ABA, behavior training, speech/OT/PT, medications). The statute also requires autism screening at 18 and 24 months.',
          'The dollar terms split at the same birthday: under age 10 there is no dollar cap, and at age 10 and older the plan isn\'t required to cover ABA beyond $36,000 per year (§ 1355.015(c-1)). That cap should be framed carefully: ASD is generally treated as a mental health condition, and an annual dollar limit on MH benefits sits in tension with federal parity law for parity-covered large-group plans — the standard industry reading is that many fully-insured large-group plans don\'t enforce it, though we found no TDI or federal guidance document confirming that, so treat the parity argument as analysis, not settled rule. Exemptions: the state-employee (ERS) and UT/A&M system plans are carved out, self-funded ERISA plans are exempt by federal preemption, and small-group applicability has a genuine statutory ambiguity — § 1355.015 has no small-employer subsection, so confirm small-group cases with TDI rather than assuming either way.',

Code § 1355.015, enacted by HB 1919 in 2007 and expanded several times since — applies to group health benefit plans (group policies, HMOs, group hospital service contracts, and TRS school-employee plans), and it has a structure intake teams must internalize: coverage runs from the date of diagnosis, but only if the ASD diagnosis was in place before the child\'s 10th birthday. Once eligible, coverage continues — the statute sets no upper age cutoff on continuing benefits. Covered services are broad ("all generally recognized services": evaluation, ABA, behavior training, speech/OT/PT, medications). The statute also requires autism screening at 18 and 24 months.',
          'The dollar terms split at the same birthday: under age 10 there is no dollar cap, and at age 10 and older the plan isn\'t required to cover ABA beyond $36,000 per year (§ 1355.015(c-1)). That cap should be framed carefully: ASD is generally treated as a mental health condition, and an annual dollar limit on MH benefits sits in tension with federal parity law for parity-covered large-group plans — the standard industry reading is that many fully-insured large-group plans don\'t enforce it, though we found no TDI or federal guidance document confirming that, so treat the parity argument as analysis, not settled rule. Exemptions: the state-employee (ERS) and UT/A&M system plans are carved out, self-funded ERISA plans are exempt by federal preemption, and small-group applicability has a genuine statutory ambiguity — § 1355.015 has no small-employer subsection, so confirm small-group cases with TDI rather than assuming either way.',

Code § 1355.015, enacted by HB 1919 in 2007 and expanded several times since — applies to group health benefit plans (group policies, HMOs, group hospital service contracts, and TRS school-employee plans), and it has a structure intake teams must internalize: coverage runs from the date of diagnosis, but only if the ASD diagnosis was in place before the child\'s 10th birthday. Once eligible, coverage continues — the statute sets no upper age cutoff on continuing benefits. Covered services are broad ("all generally recognized services": evaluation, ABA, behavior training, speech/OT/PT, medications). The statute also requires autism screening at 18 and 24 months.',
          'The dollar terms split at the same birthday: under age 10 there is no dollar cap, and at age 10 and older the plan isn\'t required to cover ABA beyond $36,000 per year (§ 1355.015(c-1)). That cap should be framed carefully: ASD is generally treated as a mental health condition, and an annual dollar limit on MH benefits sits in tension with federal parity law for parity-covered large-group plans — the standard industry reading is that many fully-insured large-group plans don\'t enforce it, though we found no TDI or federal guidance document confirming that, so treat the parity argument as analysis, not settled rule. Exemptions: the state-employee (ERS) and UT/A&M system plans are carved out, self-funded ERISA plans are exempt by federal preemption, and small-group applicability has a genuine statutory ambiguity — § 1355.015 has no small-employer subsection, so confirm small-group cases with TDI rather than assuming either way.',

      { q: 'Does UnitedHealthcare cover ABA therapy in Texas?', a: 'Yes — under Optum\'s national clinical criteria for ASD, layered on Texas\'s mandate (Tex. Ins. Code § 1355.015) for state-regulated group plans. Self-funded employer plans are exempt from the mandate, so always verify plan funding type first.' },
      { q: 'What does the Texas autism mandate require?', a: 'For covered group plans: treatment coverage from the date of diagnosis, provided the ASD diagnosis was made before the child\'s 10th birthday (coverage continues once eligible), with no dollar cap under 10 and a $36,000/year ABA cap at 10+ that federal parity arguably limits for large-group plans.' },

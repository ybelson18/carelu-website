    summary:
      'September 2026 monthly refresh: no inbox uploads this cycle (2 document requests remain open — REQ-001 GAMMIS companion guide, REQ-014 narrowed to Anthem GA payer ID). Watchlist + spot-checks against primary sources across all 19 states + national turned up the biggest single change since the directory launched: North Carolina\'s long-awaited CCP 8F (RB-BHT) rewrite is now published and effective 8/1/2026 — correcting a previously-unconfirmed 20% telehealth-supervision figure to the actual 50% cap, removing telehealth entirely for 97152/97153/97154, and setting hard dates for the RBT/ABAT certification grace period (starts 8/1/2026) and out-of-state LQASP/C-QP enrollment closure (8/2/2026). Ohio\'s broken OAC 5160-34 citation now has a sourced explanation (rule paused for reevaluation amid multi-state OIG ABA-overpayment findings; draft-only, not adopted) and CareSource Ohio\'s core policy (MM-0028) was replaced by a same-day successor plus a new companion reimbursement policy (PY-1638), narrowing its H0036 billing allowance. Kansas added a new ASD-diagnosis credential requirement (KMAP Bulletin 26140, eff. 9/1/2026, today). Virginia\'s FFS service-authorization login mechanism moved to DMAS\'s MES portal SSO, and a new CMS-mandated PA turnaround SLA (72hr expedited / 7-day standard) now applies to all Virginia FFS and Cardinal Care MCO behavioral-health requests. Maryland corrected a telehealth gap: 97155/97156/97157 now require at least 25% in-person delivery (PT 60-26, eff. 4/1/2026), a rule that predated but was missed in an earlier pass. Florida\'s Sunshine Health added a second new rule (PCP Acknowledgement and Care Coordination Form, eff. 8/1/2026) alongside its existing authorization-transfer rule. New York\'s per-plan enrollment figures were refreshed to the July 2026 DOH report (all five NY plans\' figures moved down slightly from June), and its forward-looking "ABA Centers of Excellence" caveat was softened — secondary budget-summary sources suggest it did not survive into the enacted FY26-27 budget, but this is unconfirmed against primary bill text (new document request opened, REQ-015). Indiana added a caregiver-coaching-floor flexibility citation (BT2026136); Nebraska\'s 20-hour weekly cap and DD-waiver carve-out facts were upgraded from inferred/secondary sourcing to a directly-cited primary bulletin (DHHS Provider Bulletin 26-06). Arizona, Colorado, and Utah watchlist items (AMPM 320-S, HB26-1425/PBT rate exemption, MIB 26-61/26-62) were all reconfirmed unchanged with stronger primary-source citations. Georgia\'s re-procurement remains frozen in the protest phase with no Notice of Award (confirmed unchanged); its GA-Medicaid Change-Healthcare payer-ID conflict is now considered resolved via existing sourcing, narrowing REQ-014 to the still-unresolved Anthem GA ID ambiguity (00101 vs. 00601), for which new corroborating-but-not-authoritative evidence points toward 00601. A cross-cutting national item was surfaced for next cycle\'s watchlist: CMS published a non-binding ABA benefit-management toolkit (8/4/2026) urging states to restrict telehealth-primary ABA delivery and tighten utilization review, citing a 421% rise in Medicaid/CHIP ABA spending 2021-2025; North Carolina has already issued a responsive bulletin (8/31/2026). New/unsourced Kansas rate figures reported only by a non-primary tracker were NOT published pending REQ-016 (KMAP portal access). NJ, MO, TX, NM, TN, and national commercial policy citations were light-pass spot-checked with no drift found (one known bot-block persists: hhs.texas.gov\'s MCO service-area map).',

Read the NCTracks 270/271 Companion Guide (ASC X12N005010X279A1, Apr 2025) in full — unlike Georgia\'s, it IS a static fetchable PDF: the 2110C EB loop (Appendix A) carries managed-care PLAN-TYPE codes (Standard/Tailored/Carve-out/Health Choice), while the specific MCO\'s identity/contact returns dynamically in the 2120C NM1/PER loop, not from a fixed carrier-name table — captured as such rather than forced into a false MCO-code map. Confirmed directly from the live CCP 8F PDF (Amended Date 2019-08-15, still in force) that NC Medicaid\'s RB-BHT code set is ONLY 97151-97157 — 97158/0362T/0373T ship as explicit "not covered" entries, not omitted or guessed. Corrected an assumed HB 696 8/1/2026 effective date after reading the ratified bill text directly: Session Law 2026-1\'s ABA provisions (Sec. 3C.18) are effective on enactment, 4/30/2026, with no rate or billing-rule change tied to 8/1/2026 anywhere in the bill, and the amended CCP 8F remains unpublished as of this access date. Confirmed Healthy Blue, AmeriHealth Caritas, and Carolina Complete Health each publish zero ABA code-level billing detail (pure 8F deference, several confirmed in the plans\' own document text); WellCare of NC\'s WNC.CP.109 is the one plan-authored CPT/modifier grid (GT/KX) in this set, kept historical per its 4/1/2026 merger into Carolina Complete Health, whose own merger page supplied the unified payer ID (68069) and legacy WellCare-only codes (PCS 23937, HHCS 57538) with an explicit pre-merger claims-rejection warning. Several EDI payer IDs surfaced clearinghouse-specific splits (different codes for claims vs. 270/271 RTE vs. ERA for the same payer, e.g. Healthy Blue, AmeriHealth Caritas NC) — each shipped with its own verifyVia note rather than collapsed into one number. UnitedHealthcare Community Plan NC: confirmed its Optum BH carve-out claims ride the SAME payer ID as medical (87726, no second EDI hop) but explicitly did NOT apply Optum\'s national ABA Modifier FAQ (HN/HO/HM/HP) to Medicaid, since that document scopes itself to "commercial members only."',

Verified NC Medicaid\'s CCP 8F billable RB-BHT code set is 97151-97157 ONLY — 97158/0362T/0373T are confirmed absent from 8F\'s own code table, from Alliance\'s and Trillium\'s rate schedules, and from Vaya\'s authorization guidelines, so codeGrid ships those three as "not in state code set" rather than inventing entries; the full 10-code CPT set applies as normal to the 3 commercial guides. None of the 4 Tailored Plans (Alliance, Trillium, Vaya, Partners) appear under their own name on pVerify\'s or Availity\'s national payer lists (both fetched and full-text searched, not skimmed) — nor does NC Medicaid itself appear on Availity\'s list — so EDI payerId ships unverified for all 4 except where a plan\'s own document gave one directly (Trillium: Change Healthcare 56089 / SSI Group 43071, from its own Claims Submission Protocol). Vaya\'s document library, reported bot-blocked in the original compile, was retried and is NOT currently blocked — its Authorization Guidelines v2.0 and RB-BHT Guidance both extracted cleanly as plain text and supplied real code-level passthrough thresholds (97151: 32 units/6mo; 97155: 10% of 97153/97154 hours), applied as \'inferred\' to the other 3 Tailored Plans per the statewide CCP 8F pattern. Partners\' payer ID 68069 was confirmed, via Partners\' own FAQ with Carolina Complete Health, to be CCH\'s PHYSICAL-health delegation ID, not a behavioral-health/RB-BHT one — shipped unverified rather than reusing it incorrectly.

      'FL VOB enrichment SPLIT A shipped (docs/vob-build.md): Layer 1 (EDI crosswalk) + Layer 3 (code-level coverage grid) for 6 guides, plus Layer 4 (Medicaid rate table) for florida-medicaid. The FLMMIS 270/271 Companion Guide (v4.0, 2023-04-27) was retrieved and read in full — unlike Georgia\'s, it is a fetchable static PDF — confirming Florida\'s canonical X12 payer ID (77027) and that managed-care enrollment in the 271 has NO fixed carrier-code table (Loop 2110C "Managed Care" repetition, MCO identity as free text in nested Loop 2120C NM103); that absence is shipped as a verified fact, not an unfilled gap. The current AHCA Behavior Analysis fee schedule was retrieved directly for both 2025 and 2026 (rates identical) and surfaced a real finding, cross-confirmed by three independent primary sources (AHCA\'s fee schedule, Sunshine Health\'s own FL.CP.BH.500 coding table, and Humana\'s Florida Medicaid PA list): CPT 97157 does not appear on any of them and ships as covered:\'No\' rather than assumed-covered. Florida also confirmed a genuine coding quirk opposite Georgia\'s pattern: only 97156 (family/caregiver training) has a stated telehealth allowance anywhere in state or plan documentation (GT modifier, 2 hrs/week cap, Rule 59G-1.057) — every other code ships telehealth:\'No\' by verified policy design. None of the 4 MCOs in this split publish a full code-level unit-cap/POS/telehealth table of their own, so each MCO codeGrid inherits the AHCA statewide baseline as \'inferred\' (per the coverage policy\'s plan-compliance clause, §1.2) and upgrades specific fields to \'verified\' only where that plan\'s own document independently confirms them — Sunshine\'s FL.CP.BH.500 clinical policy confirms the most; Simply/Carelon\'s and UHC/Optum\'s FL-specific QRGs confirm almost none. Sunshine Health\'s previously-unconfirmed BA network-enrollment pause (flagged as an unverified industry blog report in the shipped florida.ts prose) is now CONFIRMED from Sunshine\'s own newsroom: effective 2025-10-01 in all AHCA regions except A and B, partially lifted in Regions E and F starting 2026-03-01. Humana\'s non-par reimbursement, previously vague ("a percentage of..."), now has an exact figure from Humana\'s own PA form: 80% of the Florida Medicaid fee schedule absent a controlling legal requirement or Letter of Agreement. "TNFL" (Therapy Network of Florida) was investigated per the build brief and confirmed to administer BA for Community Care Plan, a Florida MMA plan OUTSIDE this split\'s 6 guides — none of the 5 MCO/state guides shipped here delegate to TNFL.',

Split B's own first-pass code grid (built from a PDF-text-extraction read of the AHCA coverage policy plus a secondary fee-schedule tracker, since AHCA's fee-schedule PDF 403s a default WebFetch User-Agent) was superseded during the merge: split A independently retrieved the ACTUAL AHCA fee-schedule PDFs (browser-spoofed request) and three MCOs' own coding documents, a materially stronger primary-source base for the identical statewide facts — per \"accuracy beats completeness,\" split B's four Medicaid MMA guides were rebuilt on split A's FL_CODE_FACTS/mcoEntry() infrastructure rather than kept on a parallel, weaker-sourced grid. Read Aetna Better Health of Florida's own Quick Reference Guide directly, confirming EDI payer ID 128FL (an upgrade over guessing past florida.ts's access-blocked-site caveat) and a Behavioral Health-specific PA phone line (1-833-365-2474) not previously documented. Read Community Care Plan's Therapy Network of Florida Behavior Analysis Provider Manual in full, confirming its EDI payer IDs (65062 professional / 12k89 institutional) verbatim, upgraded into the shared mcoEntry() confirmed-fields mechanism. Read Florida Community Care's own BA services page directly, surfacing a previously-undocumented fact: Behavioral Services Network (BSN) is FCC's behavioral-health network partner for credentialing (as it also is for Aetna Better Health of Florida) even though FCC's own Utilization Department still adjudicates BA prior authorizations in-house.

      'NY split B shipped (docs/vob-build.md): Layer 1 (EDI routing crosswalk) + Layer 3 (code-level coverage grid) for 8 guides — the 5 upstate Medicaid MCOs (Excellus, MVP, CDPHP, Independent Health, Highmark Western & Northeastern NY) plus Aetna, Cigna, and UnitedHealthcare commercial. Layer 4 (Medicaid rates) intentionally NOT populated for any of the 5 MCOs: none publish their own ABA fee schedule, and the state eMedNY schedule is FFS-only and explicitly doesn\'t bind MMC plans (per the existing new-york-medicaid guide\'s own sourced text) — commercial gets no rates per spec either. Re-fetched pVerify\'s and Availity\'s public payer-list PDFs and, since both defeat naive text extraction (columns collapse into disjoint blocks), parsed them to structured tables this pass rather than reusing unconfirmed numbers. Resolved two ambiguities this corpus\'s Georgia guide had left open for the same commercial carriers: UnitedHealthcare\'s Optum Behavioral Health carve-out payer ID (UHG007, pVerify) and a plain "87726 UNITEDHEALTHCARE" Availity entry (Georgia\'s guide found none). Discovered the fetched Availity PDF carries an "As of 08/08/2012" footer — consistent with this corpus\'s prior aetna-florida finding on the same URL — so every Availity-sourced ID here ships \'inferred\', not \'verified\', except MVP\'s (independently confirmed via MVP\'s own 2025 Provider Policies document naming Payee ID 14165 directly). Captured the Medicaid-specific pVerify line item where one exists (Highmark: "01357 HIGHMARK BCBS WESTERN NY - MEDICAID AND CHP", distinct from its general "00325 BCBS of Western New York" and legacy "00326 Healthnow" entries) and flagged plain ambiguity honestly where none does (CDPHP: two unresolved generic candidates, 00328 and 002466; MVP: pVerify\'s only match is Child-Health-Plus-labeled, not a general MMC line; Excellus: no Medicaid-specific line among several regional sub-brand entries). Independent Health\'s codeGrid and BH-carve-out fields ship mostly \'inferred\'/\'unverified\' because its MediSource member handbook describes ABA by service category, not CPT code, and never states outright whether Carelon (which the plan says administers general BH) or Independent Health itself adjudicates ABA specifically — the handbook\'s own section placement is the only (indirect) evidence. Highmark WNY\'s codeGrid carries the richest confirmed telehealth detail in this split (97151/97153/97155/97156/97157 via POS 02 + modifier 95/GT, from a 2020/Jan-2022 COVID-era bulletin) alongside its stated $45,000/calendar-year benefit maximum. Commercial codeGrid entries mirror Georgia\'s finding that none of the three carriers publish code-level unit caps, POS codes, or modifiers nationally, layering on New York\'s 680-hour/year mandate cap and LBA-licensure requirement (DFS Circular Letter 6; NYSED Article 167) as notes since both are verified for New York directly. QA spot-check: re-opened Cigna\'s Autism Resource Guide, MVP\'s FastFax #2025.16, and Highmark\'s COVID-19 telehealth bulletin directly against the claims made from them in the guide prose — all three matched.',

Aetna, Anthem/Elevance, and the independent-BCBS-licensee family default all ship honestly 'unverified': no commercial-line 270/271 companion guide with an STC table could be located publicly for any of the three (only an unrelated Aetna Medicare Supplement product's guide was found) — Availity Payer Spaces, where this documentation likely lives, requires authenticated access this pass did not have.",

Preserved Humana Healthy Horizons\' genuine 0362T PA quirk (PA-required, deviating from the DMAS assessment-code baseline) and Anthem HealthKeepers Plus\' published code/modifier/POS grid (GT telehealth on 97151/97153/97155/97156; school POS 03 on 97151/97155/97156). cigna-virginia intentionally ships NO PA panel: EN0499 excludes VA fully-insured business, so its codeGrid is plan-dependent/exclusion-honest rather than inventing PA verdicts. NEW JERSEY: read the NJMMIS/Gainwell 5010 270/271 companion guide (Dec 2022) in full — MCO enrollment surfaces in Loop 2110C (EB04=HM; REF01=18 → REF02 3-digit plan code, REF03 plan name) and Loop 2120C (NM101=PRP → NM103 MCO name/PER phone), the pre-selection FFS window is the documented basis for the no-PA-pending-enrollment fast-start, eligibility is real-time with a monthly guarantee; the 3-digit-code→MCO-name crosswalk is NOT in the guide (Appendix 3 lists only eligibility categories) so mcoCarrierCodes ships empty with a verifyVia. NJ FFS rates: 97153 $15.00 (raised from $11.20 eff 2/1/2022), 97155 $21.25, 97156 $25.00 confirmed CURRENT (NJMMIS Procedure Master Listing CY2026 Q2 via ProviderSpark); the remaining codes carry launch-era values from the Aetna Better Health NJ 2020 rate sheet (which reproduces the state MUE daily-unit table verbatim) with an unverified-as-current flag + a portal-download verifyVia. Corrected two carve-out assumptions from EDI research: Wellpoint\'s Carelon relationship is utilization-management ONLY (BH/ABA claims ride WLPNT via Availity; abaRidesOn=medical), and UHC Community Plan / UHC commercial use Optum for the BH network but claims ride the medical payer ID (87726) — both recorded abaRidesOn=medical, not bh. cigna-new-jersey (unlike cigna-virginia) ships a real EN0499 PA panel (no PA on 97151/97152/0362T; treatment PA required) since NJ has no carve-out. Verified payer IDs across all 18 guides against pVerify (Mar 2026) and the Optum/Change Healthcare professional-claims list; Availity IDs read only from the stale 2012 public snapshot ship inferred/unverified pending a current export.',

      'Ohio + Missouri VOB enrichment shipped (docs/vob-build.md): Layer 1 (EDI routing crosswalk), Layer 3 (code-level coverage grid), and Layer 4 (Medicaid rate tables, Medicaid lines only) for all 11 Ohio guides and all 4 Missouri guides. OHIO 270/271: worked the known obstacle — managedcare.medicaid.ohio.gov and the ODM companion-guide listing page both 404 to automated fetch, but the ODM Next Generation Fiscal Intermediary (Gainwell) 5010 270/271 Companion Guide v13.0 (2023-06-30) was retrieved directly from Ohio\'s asset CDN and read in full: Loop 2110C EB01=\'MC\' flags MCO enrollment, the MCO entity is named free-text in Loop 2120C NM1 (NM101=\'PR\'), EB05 carries the coded plan-coverage description, eligibility spans are MONTHLY (EB06=\'34\'), and the guide carries a FIXED ODM trading-partner code table (ISA06/08) plus a 2100A NM109 MCE-payer-ID table that make each MCO — including Aetna OhioRISE (trading partner 0021914 / MCE payer 60054) — separately visible on the wire. Encoded the OhioRISE landmine as a verified 271 fact: OhioRISE IS visible in eligibility but per ODM\'s Mixed Services Protocol NEVER pays ABA; the member\'s medical MCO does. Ohio rates ship from ODM\'s ABA fee appendix (Appendix A to draft rule 5160-34-03, package ERF188422B.pdf) — the only published ODM ABA fee document, transcribed verbatim with its DRAFT/not-yet-filed status and blank effective-date column flagged rather than presented as in-force; codes.ohio.gov (in-force OAC 5160-34) is JS/bot-gated and could not be re-read. Ohio prices by practitioner-tier descriptor (Independent COBA/BCBA/BCBA-D · BCaBA · RBT), NOT by HN/HO/HM modifier — codeGrid modifiers ship accordingly. Per-code daily caps use the CMS NCCI MUE ceiling enumerated verbatim in CareSource MM-0028 (verified there, inferred elsewhere; the state rule sets none of its own). Both bot-blocks from the original compile were RETRIED and are no longer blocked (AmeriHealth Caritas OH BH PA page and Molina OH PA page both load); Optum\'s OH Medicaid LOCG PDF and Anthem\'s CG-BEH-02 GPP asset are JS-gated / not-extractable, so those plans\' per-code detail ships \'inferred\'/\'unverified\' with a verifyVia. Confirmed Anthem OH Medicaid\'s Carelon relationship is a UM/prior-authorization hop ONLY (Carelon "provides utilization management services on behalf of the health plan") — ABA claims have no second hop and ride the ODM FI to Anthem\'s MCE payer ID 0002937, resolving the OH-Anthem-Carelon gap the Layer 6 map flagged as unconfirmed. MISSOURI: reconfirmed the ABA FFS carve-out (ABA billed to state FFS even for MCO enrollees) against two sources newer than the corpus\'s prior 7/2023 statement — the MO HealthNet Managed Care Policy Statements "Effective 10/2024" (SFY25) and Healthy Blue\'s Sep-2025 provider manual, both quoting it verbatim (staleRisk downgraded to low). The eMOMED 5010 270/271 Companion Guide (Dec 2023) documents managed-care enrollment via EB04=\'MC\' in Loop 2110C (ME code in EB05 / REF02 when REF01=\'M7\'), the MCO plan hotline in Loop 2120C PER04, MO HealthNet\'s in-transaction identifier NM109=\'431754897\', monthly eligibility keyed to calendar-month boundaries, and NO carrier-code->MCO-name table (values resolve from the Health Plan Record Layout Manual §C-45) — the ABA carve-out is a routing fact, not a discrete 271 field. The MHD Applied Behavioral Analysis fee schedule (.xlsx, file-stamped 2026-07-07) was parsed directly: all 10 codes covered and priced by tier (HO behavior analyst/psychologist · HN assistant · HM RBT-billed-by-supervisor, plus U8 in-home and TM telehealth), with the fee file marking every TM row precert-not-required and no U8 row ever paired with a technician (HM) combination. Availity\'s public payer list (2012-dated) has no Missouri Medicaid row and is unreliable for the OH MCOs; pVerify codes captured as pVerify-internal (not X12 CPIDs); Change Healthcare CPIDs remain login-gated and ship unverified. The 6 commercial guides (Aetna/Cigna/UnitedHealthcare in each state) get Layers 1+3 only per spec, reusing the already-verified national policies (CPB 0554/0648, EN0499, Optum SCC/2022RP501A) with the state autism mandates noted (OH R.C. 3923.84 floors; MO RSMo 376.1224 $40k/yr cap); Cigna\'s per-code PA split ships \'unverified\' consistent with this corpus\'s cigna-texas EN0499 re-verification, and Optum\'s ABA State Mandates supplement HAS an Ohio entry (CNS/CNP ordering, eff. 3/2025) but no Missouri entry.',

NM: the LOD #53 ABA fee schedule (eff. 1/1/2025) ships verbatim with the full U5/U4/U3/U9/U1 credential ladder, and — because LOD #53 makes that FFS schedule an enforceable rate FLOOR for every Turquoise Care MCO and sub-vendor — the four MCO guides carry it as a verified minimum (their own paid rate at/above it is not published). PA verdicts come from the fee schedule\'s per-code flags (97153 + 0373T = PA; assessment/most treatment = no PA), independently confirmed for UHC Community Plan by its Turquoise Care QRG. The NM 271 MCO-enrollment loop/segment and carrier-code map ship \'unverified\' — the NM MMIS portal is Incapsula-blocked and NM routes 270/271 through the generic Conduent Eligibility Gateway (payer ID 00000001234); the HCA Turquoise Care Systems Manual\'s MCO/TPL constants are recorded as the closest (834/TPL, not 271) mapping. AZ: the AHCCCS ABA fee schedule (fixed rates eff. 11/1/2023, verified unchanged through FY26) ships with HM/HN/HO/HP tiers and the POS-12 home premium — with corrections vs. the guide prose (97155/97151/97158 have no HM tier; $25.05 is 97155-HN, not HM), and 97156/97157 (By Report) + 0362T/0373T (off the ABA schedule) ship \'unverified\'. The AHCCCS 5010A 270/271 Companion Guide v4.0 WAS retrievable: medicaid271Notes carries the verified 2120C NM1*Y2 managed-care segment and the 6-digit plan codes actually shown in its worked examples (Mercy Care 010306, AzCH 010422, DCS/CMDP 010166, CRS, AIHP, QMB/SLMB); UHCCP/Banner/Health-Choice/Molina 6-digit codes are not enumerated there → unverified. arizona-ddd carries no standalone payer ID (ABA rides the member\'s DDD Health Plan, Mercy Care DD 86052 or UHCCP DD 03432; DDD enrollment resolves in one 271 hop via EB05 "DDD Subcontractor Plan" + NM1*Y2). AHCCCS integrated BH into ACC (2018)/DDD (2019), so ABA rides each plan\'s medical payer ID — no BH carve-out, no two-hop. One unresolved conflict shipped as-is: UHC Community Plan NM claims ID — the Optum NM ABA QRG says 87726/ERA 86047, but UHC\'s own current affiliate list shows NM Medicaid = 87748 (87726 = NM Dual SNP) and 86047 = New Jersey. Cigna/Evernorth confirmed as a same-ID pass-through (62308) in both states. Commercial guides carry EDI + code grid but no rate table (contract-specific).',

      "Massachusetts + Maryland VOB enrichment shipped: Layers 1 (EDI routing crosswalk), 3 (code-level coverage grid, 97151-97158/0362T/0373T), and 4 (Medicaid rate tables) populated for all 10 MA guides (masshealth-massachusetts-medicaid, mbhp, wellsense, tufts-health-together, fallon, health-new-england, mass-general-brigham-health-plan, aetna/cigna/unitedhealthcare-massachusetts) and all 4 MD guides (maryland-medicaid, aetna/cigna/unitedhealthcare-maryland). MASSACHUSETTS: the MassHealth 270/271 companion guide (Nov 2023) confirms managed-care enrollment rides Loop 2110C (EB01=L/MC/D, EB05 returns the plan name as free text — NO numeric carrier-code table exists, unlike the coded 2120C tables some other states publish). 101 CMR 358.03's official fee schedule was retrieved in full: it prices exactly 7 codes (97151/97155/97156=$30.73, 97153=$16.37, 97154=$13.91, 97157=$26.12, H0031-U2=$30.73) and CONFIRMS 97152/97158/0362T/0373T absent from the schedule (individual-consideration pricing per 358.03(4)(b), not a retrieval gap). The Carelon/MBHP ABA Performance Specification (updated 2/15/2026) confirms a group-session cap (4.5 hrs/day, 2-8 members) but NO per-code unit caps, POS codes, or telehealth modifiers anywhere — shipped as a confirmed absence. WellSense's own EDI companion guide (Mar 2024) is flagged as out-of-date on BH-carve-out routing since WellSense insourced ABA administration from Carelon 1/1/2026; Mass General Brigham Health Plan's Optum BH payer ID (87726) is confirmed to be the SAME number as UnitedHealthcare's national medical payer ID, an unresolved routing ambiguity flagged rather than silently resolved. MARYLAND: the single most load-bearing finding — Maryland's own 270/271 companion guide (2013, the only version published) contains ZERO references to \"BHASO,\" \"Carelon,\" \"Beacon,\" or any behavioral-health administrator anywhere in its 22 pages; a plain 270/271 against Maryland Medicaid's MMIS does NOT surface the ABA carve-out, so hop-2 routing to Carelon has to be hard-coded business logic, not detected from the wire. Carelon became Maryland's BHASO only recently (1/1/2025, succeeding Optum) — MDH's own Provider Transmittal PT 54-25 names the Carelon submitter ID as BHOMD (superseding Optum-era OMDBH), independently corroborated by Claim.MD's payer registry; shipped as 'inferred' rather than 'verified' for ABA specifically since no ABA-named transmittal citing BHOMD was found. The MD ABA fee schedule's two remaining rate gaps (97154, 97158) were filled directly from the manual's pp.15-16 table ($10.45/$8.36/$6.96 tiered per-participant for 97154; $10.45 for 97158), and Maryland's telehealth eligibility rule (GT modifier limited to direct supervision, parent training, group parent training) is shipped as a confirmed negative for all other codes, not an omission. pVerify's payer-list page returned a Cloudflare bot-block on direct retrieval for Maryland this pass — every pVerify-sourced field for the 4 MD guides ships 'unverified' rather than from an unconfirmed scrape.",

The shared tri-MCO "ABA Provider Requirements and Program Description" and "Universal Request for ABA" form (both fetched and read in full) cover only 97151-97158 — 0362T/0373T appear in neither document, so tenncare-tennessee-medicaid, unitedhealthcare-community-plan-tennessee, and wellpoint-tennessee ship those two codes "not confirmed in the shared code set." BlueCare Tennessee is the one confirmed exception: its own 563-page Provider Administration Manual DOES list both codes with full CPT descriptions — a genuine per-MCO difference shipped as-is. TennCare\'s public "EDI Front Matter" (V8.0, fetched and read in full) confirms 270/271 is handled directly by the state (not brokered through the MCOs) via real-time SOAP or batch SFTP, but the loop/segment/carrier-code detail lives in the TennCare Companion Guide, available to registered trading partners only on request (EDI.TennCare@tn.gov) — medicaid271Notes ships unverified for that reason, same treatment as Georgia\'s inaccessible GAMMIS guide. A genuine cross-source EDI conflict was found and flagged rather than resolved: UHC\'s own 5/13/2026 Claims Payer List gives UnitedHealthcare Community Plan of Tennessee a dedicated Medical Payer ID (95378) distinct from the multi-state 87726 grouping, but the stale 2012 Availity snapshot maps that same 95378 to a different UHC affiliate entirely ("United Healthcare of River Valley").

The state\'s own 20-vs-30-hour weekly cap conflict is preserved honestly: the treatment MSD\'s literal text caps direct-service codes at 20 hrs/week, while Provider Bulletin 25-02 and the DHHS ABA Facts page describe policy as allowing up to 30 hrs/week — both figures given in codeGrid notes rather than resolved by fiat. Telehealth (modifier 95, POS 02/10) confirmed allowed only for 97151/97155/97156, explicitly prohibited for 97152/97153/97154/97158.

      'TEXAS (community-health-choice-texas, bcbs-texas-medicaid, cook-childrens-health-plan, parkland-community-health-plan, el-paso-health, firstcare-health-plans): codeGrid and rates reuse the TMHP program-wide baseline (tmppmCodeGrid/mcoUnverifiedRates) already shipped and cited for the other 8 TX MCO guides in vob/texas.ts, with plan-specific facts pulled only from each plan\'s own documents already cited in src/data/payers/texas.ts. Two genuine plan-specific contradictions of the shared "not on Texas\'s billable ABA code set" finding were confirmed and shipped as-is rather than collapsed to the state default: Parkland Community Health Plan\'s own PA Requirements list (eff. 9/1/2025) explicitly names 97152 and 97157 under "Applied Behavior Analysis" (new pchpPaListCode() override, mirroring the existing driscollPortalCode() pattern). Two behavioral-health insourcing transitions are recorded as current-state facts: BCBSTX Medicaid insourced BH from Magellan in 2024 (bhCarveOut.administrator: \'none\', with the historical Magellan reference flagged stale); Parkland insourced BH from Carelon effective 9/1/2025 (same treatment). FirstCare\'s Medicaid plans are flagged as winding down (FirstCare\'s own site: "plans end 8/31/2026, subject to regulatory approval") in edi.verifyVia and codeGrid notes. EDI payerId fields for all 6 new TX guides ship the literal \'unverified\' with verifyVia notes — no pVerify/Availity/Change Healthcare payer-list entry could be independently confirmed this pass for these 6 specific plans (as opposed to a same-named commercial affiliate or an ambiguous multi-entry match); Texas\'s already-established centralized TMHP 270/271 architecture (medicaid271Notes on texas-medicaid) still applies to all 6 as Medicaid MCOs, but a distinct clearinghouse-side payer ID per plan was not confirmed. ' +
      "NATIONAL (new src/data/payers/vob/national.ts, spread into vob/index.ts as nationalVob): aetna, cigna, unitedhealthcare-optum ship Layers 1+3 only, no rates (\"do not attempt commercial rates\" per docs/vob-build.md). EDI payer IDs reuse the generic national pVerify/Availity/Change Healthcare codes already established (and labeled generic, not state-specific) in vob/texas.ts's commercial entries: Aetna 00001/60054, Cigna 00004/62308, UnitedHealthcare 00192/87726. bhCarveOut fields reuse vob/carveouts.ts's Layer 6 'US' rows directly: Cigna -> Evernorth Behavioral Health (62308, no second EDI hop, confirmed identical in 18 of 19 states' guides) ships verified; Aetna ships fully unverified (no BH administrator named in any of the 19 states researched); UnitedHealthcare/Optum deliberately has no national default in carveouts.ts (payer ID and administered-on side genuinely vary by state — 87726 in FL/NC vs. UHG007 in NY, unresolved against each other) and ships administratorPayerId 'unverified' rather than picking one state's value. codeGrid unitCap/posAllowed ship 'plan-dependent' (not 'unverified') for most codes — a national commercial guide spans fully-insured and self-funded/ERISA plans across every state mandate, and none of the three clinical policies (CPB 0554/0648, EN0499, Optum's ABA Supplemental Clinical Criteria + Reimbursement Policy 2022RP501A) state a universal unit/session structure, so 'plan-dependent' reflects plan variation rather than a research gap. Where a national policy DOES state a concrete figure, it ships with its own fieldStatus instead: Aetna's per-code telehealth list (97151/97153/97155/97156/97157 covered, 97152 excluded, GT/95/FR modifiers) and Cigna's \"all ABA CPT codes are covered telehealth services\" both ship verified; Optum's cluster-based max-daily-unit and modifier-tier figures (Reimbursement Policy 2022RP501A) are quoted in codeGrid notes but the formal unitCap field still ships 'plan-dependent' per the same national-variation reasoning. 99366 ships 'unverified' for all 3 national guides — none of the three source documents address interdisciplinary team-meeting billing. Cigna's codeGrid reuses the QA correction already recorded in vob/texas.ts: EN0499 does not actually state a per-code PA distinction between assessment and treatment codes despite the base guide's prose describing one, so paRequired ships 'unverified' per code rather than re-asserting the un-sourced claim.",

Cook Children's Health Plan: pVerify 01077 (no CHIP/STAR split); Availity CCHP1 (CHIP) / CCHP9 (STAR, STAR Kids), cross-validated by the plan's own EDI page.

El Paso Health: pVerify's only entry (00796) is explicitly CHIP-scoped; Availity splits into 5 line-of-business-specific codes (EPF02 STAR/STAR+PLUS, EPF03 CHIP, EPF37 Healthcare Options, EPF10/EPF11 Preferred Administrators), all independently confirmed by the plan's own payer-ID PDF; Change Healthcare/Optum ships a verified absence (the plan's own documentation states its clearinghouse relationship is Availity + TriZetto only). FirstCare Health Plans: pVerify 01105 (generic, no Medicaid split); Availity distinguishes 94998 (Medicaid) from 94999 (general/commercial) — and a materially more important fact surfaced during this research: TMHP (7/17/2026) and Texas HHS (7/21/2026) both confirmed Baylor Scott & White/FirstCare is exiting Texas Medicaid managed care effective 9/1/2026 (TMHP will not accept claims with dates of service after 8/31/2026), upgrading the prior entry's softer 'plan's own site says subject to regulatory approval' framing to a confirmed exit date across two independent state sources. pVerify's page is JS-rendered and was queried via repeated matching results rather than an independent raw-HTML grep, so its values ship fieldStatus 'inferred' throughout this correction; Availity's and Optum's master-list PDFs were downloaded and text-extracted directly, so their values ship 'verified' where a clean single match was found.",

A verified phone number was found for all 62 guides; where a fetch 403\'d, was JS-rendered, or the document simply had no contact section (e.g. several state Medicaid EDI portals already flagged blocked in docs/vob-gaps.md), the field was omitted per the "never fill with \'unverified\'" rule rather than invented — VobContact.providerServicesPhone was correspondingly made optional in types.ts. scriptedQuestions were generated (not scraped) per guide from that guide\'s OWN already-shipped edi.verifyVia keys, edi.bhCarveOut fields marked \'unverified\', stcMap fields marked \'unverified\'/\'plan-dependent\', and codeGrid fields marked \'unverified\' — 372 questions across the 62 guides (avg 6.0/guide, range 4-7); none qualified for the empty-array no-call outcome since Layer 1-3 data for these 5 states is still heavily unverified/plan-dependent across the board. No edi/stcMap/codeGrid/rates content was modified.',

    summary:
      "Layer 7 contacts + scripted questions: remaining 14 states (docs/vob-build.md) — vobContact added to all 104 guides across vob/{arizona,colorado,indiana,kansas,massachusetts,maryland,missouri,nebraska,new-jersey,new-mexico,ohio,tennessee,utah,virginia}.ts (GA/NC/FL/TX/NY tracked separately). Contact data was mined cheapest-first: nearly every guide's own already-cited quick-reference guides, PA forms, and provider manuals — sourced during the prior Layers 1/3/4 passes — already quoted a phone/fax/UM line verbatim in their `note` text (e.g. Ohio's Buckeye PA form, AmeriHealth Caritas BH page, Humana PAL; Kansas's Sunflower QRG; Nebraska's Molina PA page); those were reused directly rather than re-fetched. Genuine gaps (hours, portal URLs, payers with nothing in their existing sources) were filled via fresh WebFetch of the same cited documents' contact sections or a targeted WebSearch for the payer's official quick-reference/contact page — dozens of new source URLs were added this pass (Optum/Provider Express, Availity, Evernorth/Cigna BH provider-service pages, state Medicaid contact/EVS pages, MCO quick-reference guides). The high-stakes rule held throughout: a phone or fax number ships only where it was personally read in a fetched document; where no verifiable number existed (Aetna's member-ID-card-only precert routing in most states, Mercy Care Arizona, Molina Ohio's own portal-confirm hedge, several commercial UHC/Optum lines with no ABA-specific number, Arizona DDD's no-standalone-line structure), the field is omitted rather than filled with a placeholder — zero guides carry the literal 'unverified' in a phone/fax field. `VobContact.providerServicesPhone` was changed from required to optional in types.ts to make that omission representable. scriptedQuestions were generated per guide from that guide's OWN edi/stcMap/codeGrid fieldStatus/unverified markers — not templated — averaging 3.85 questions/guide (range 1–6, e.g. Ohio's cigna-ohio and aetna-ohio at 5 each vs. Kansas's cigna-kansas at 2 and the EXITED mdwise-indiana at 1); no guide came back with zero unverified fields, so none shipped an empty array. Two corrections surfaced mid-pass: a genuine unterminated-string syntax error in missouri.ts's Aetna quick-reference source (mismatched quote delimiters) was caught by `tsc -b` (the project-references build tsc invokes) and fixed, and WellSense Massachusetts's own current Quick Reference Guide still lists Carelon as the BH/ABA contact — in tension with this corpus's existing '(WellSense insourced ABA 1/1/2026)' claim — flagged as that guide's lead scripted question rather than silently overwritten. QA spot-check (Layer 9): re-opened the cited source for kansas-medicaid (KMAP companion guide contact section), ohio-medicaid (ODM PNM Contact Us page), and new-jersey-medicaid (DMAHS BH Integration Points of Contact PDF) — all three vobContact phone numbers matched the re-fetched documents verbatim.",

      "Layer 2 completion: stcMap on all 179 guides (16 verified / 226 inferred / 829 unverified). Closes the gap left after the original Layer 2 pass (GA/NC/FL/TX/NY + scattered gap-fill), which covered 70 of 179 guides; the remaining 109 — the 14 states delivered after that pass (AZ, CO, IN, KS, MA, MD, MO, NE, NJ, NM, OH, TN, UT, VA) plus the 3 national commercial guides (aetna, cigna, unitedhealthcare-optum) — now carry a Layer 2 stcMap. Commercial guides (aetna-<state>/cigna-<state>/unitedhealthcare-<state>) inherit the existing Cigna/Evernorth, UnitedHealthcare/Optum, and Aetna family defaults (src/data/payers/vob/stc-defaults.ts) via inheritFamilyStc, all fields 'inferred' except the fields those family defaults themselves ship 'unverified' (Aetna's entire family default, and copayUnit/oopMaxApplies for Cigna/UHC — no primary companion-guide addresses per-visit-vs-per-day copay timing or OOP-max application for any family). The 3 national commercial guides (aetna/cigna/unitedhealthcare-optum) carry the family-default stcMap directly, not inherited, since they ARE that family's canonical source guide. State-Medicaid guides and their MCOs ship overwhelmingly 'unverified' by design, not by oversight: per state, each guide's own already-fetched 270/271 companion guide (Layer 1 sourcing) was checked for a service-type-code support table, and in every one of the 14 states no such table was locatable (several companion-guide portals 403 automated fetches entirely, matching the already-documented Colorado/Georgia pattern; others document MCO-enrollment loop/segment mechanics but not STC-level financial detail) — so 'unverified' with a verifyVia note (state EDI/fiscal-agent help desk, or the specific MCO's provider services) is the honest, correct output per the \"never guess\" rule, not a placeholder. Three exceptions surfaced real, citable facts instead of the unverified default: utah-medicaid (UT_PRISM_COMPANION_GUIDE states Utah Medicaid returns eligibility only at the generic STC '30' bucket, not procedure-code level — abaBenefitBucket/quality271Score ship 'verified'); select-health-utah (inherits utah-medicaid's stcMap via inheritFamilyStc, since this file's own edi layer already documents Select Health's ABA benefit is carved out entirely to Utah Medicaid FFS — Select Health never adjudicates it); and maryland-medicaid (Carelon BHASO's own national 270/271 companion guide, already cited in this file's edi.bhCarveOut, states verbatim it \"treats all inquiries as Service Type Code 30\" — abaBenefitBucket '30'/quality271Score 'low' ship 'inferred'; MD's own ABA manual states the program is \"payment-in-full\" with no balance-billing, supporting deductibleAppliesToAba 'no' as 'verified' and oopMaxApplies false as 'inferred'). No state's Layer-0 prose (src/data/payers/<state>.ts) carried a citable EPSDT $0-cost-share fact beyond Maryland's payment-in-full statement, so deductibleAppliesToAba/costShareType ship honestly 'unverified' everywhere else rather than assumed from the general EPSDT pattern.",

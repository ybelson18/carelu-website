The codified rules: assessments must be in-person (telehealth assessments aren\'t reimbursed absent a documented exception); telehealth is removed entirely — no documented-necessity exception remains — for the three paraprofessional-delivered codes 97152, 97153, and 97154; 97151 keeps telehealth eligibility with clinical justification; 97155 keeps telehealth but capped at a maximum of 50% of total 97155 billing per beneficiary per 180-calendar-day period; 97156/97157 keep their own separate telephonic/KX caregiver-access-barrier exception, unchanged; the 10% LQASP observation floor is codified; paraprofessionals must hold RBT or ABAT certification within 120 calendar days, and that grace-period clock started on August 1, 2026 for staff already employed but not yet certified, not just new hires — after the window, claims for non-certified paraprofessionals aren\'t reimbursed; no new out-of-state BCBA/QASP-supervisor enrollments, and effective August 2, 2026 all LQASPs/C-QPs must enroll as in-state providers; and plans above 16 hours/week move to a 90-day initial-and-reauthorization cadence (plans at or under 16 hours/week keep the existing 180-day cadence) — a step down from the monthly-reapproval-softened-to-quarterly compromise in the budget signed July 7, 2026. NC Medicaid\'s transition guidance is explicit that existing prior authorizations aren\'t affected: providers don\'t need to take any action on existing authorizations, and no action will be taken to reduce an existing PA\'s duration — the new 90-day cadence binds only future reauthorizations. One correction to flag: NC Health News reporting (7/15/2026, quoting DHHS) had described the telehealth LQASP supervision cap as 20%; the finalized policy sets it at 50%, not 20% — treat the 20% figure as superseded. That same reporting\'s ~40-mile-radius detail on the out-of-state supervisor restriction still isn\'t confirmed in the finalized policy text available to us, so continue to treat it as reported, not codified.',

          'Start with the technician layer, because S.L. 2026-1 changed it: behavior technicians must be certified — RBT (BACB) or ABAT (QABA) — within 120 calendar days of their date of hire (or the agency\'s first Medicaid enrollment, whichever is later). The finalized CCP 8F, effective August 1, 2026, adds a specific wrinkle for the existing workforce: that same 120-day grace-period clock started running on August 1, 2026 for paraprofessional staff already on payroll but not yet certified, not only for new hires. New hires and existing staff alike may render services during the window under all required supervision, but the finalized policy is blunt about the consequence once the window closes: claims for non-certified paraprofessionals are not reimbursed. The BACB\'s own 2026 requirements have to fit inside that clock: a 40-hour training that must span at least 5 days, an initial competency assessment, an employer-run criminal background check plus a separate abuse-registry check completed within 180 days before the application (both reviewed by a BCBA-level Attesting Certificant who signs the attestation form), and the Pearson VUE exam — so start the packet on day one of employment, not day sixty.',
          'NC then stacks two state statutes on the BACB layer. G.S. 122C-80 requires a criminal history check for unlicensed hires at MH/DD/SA providers: a state check for applicants who\'ve lived in NC five-plus years, state plus national fingerprint-based check for more recent arrivals, with the check request submitted within five business days of the conditional offer (conditional employment pending results is allowed, and a relevant conviction is weighed for seriousness, recency, and nexus to the job — not automatically disqualifying). Separately, G.S. 131E-256 requires checking the Health Care Personnel Registry BEFORE hiring any unlicensed staff with direct access — community-based DD service providers are covered even without a 122C license — and each registry access must be noted in your business files. The fourth layer is agency-level: NCTracks screens the enrolling organization and its 5%+ owners under the federal risk-based rules (42 CFR Part 455), with fingerprint-based checks for high-risk categories — confirm your agency\'s current risk category with NCTracks provider enrollment, and note that managed-care contracting never substitutes for NCTracks enrollment.',
          'Supervisors need an NC license, not just a certification: behavior analysts license through the NC Behavior Analyst Licensure Board (G.S. Chapter 90, Article 43) — LBA (current BCBA or QBA) at a $250 application fee, LaBA (BCaBA or QASP-S) at $200, each plus a $14 criminal-background-check fee run through Castle Branch (package VN90) and a completed fingerprint record card, submitted via the board\'s Licensure Gateway portal. Direct Medicaid enrollment as a BCBA requires both the certification and the license (taxonomy 103K00000X). The S.L. 2026-1 supervision floors are now codified in the finalized CCP 8F (effective 8/1/2026): at least 10% of all paraprofessional-delivered services must involve LQASP observation and direction; for beneficiaries above 200 paraprofessional hours per 180-day period, LQASP hours must land between 10% and 20% of paraprofessional hours, documented in the treatment plan with deviations clinically justified; telehealth on 97155 is capped at a maximum of 50% of total 97155 billing per beneficiary per 180-calendar-day period; telehealth is removed entirely (no exception) for 97152, 97153, and 97154; and out-of-state BCBAs can no longer newly enroll — effective August 2, 2026, all LQASPs/C-QPs must enroll as in-state providers. Plan-level certification adds essentially nothing on top — Alliance\'s RB-BHT guidance and WellCare\'s WNC.CP.109 both defer to the state baseline — the plans\' real staffing exposure is agency certification reviews against DMH/DD/SAS standards and 10A NCAC 27G personnel files (job descriptions, supervision plans), not extra background checks.',

    intro: [
      'Alliance Health is one of NC\'s four Tailored Plans, and for ABA providers it stands out on two fronts: it publishes an actual rate schedule (the clearest public confirmation of the state fee-schedule floor in action), and its February 2026 RB-BHT guidance enforces diagnostic-instrument and service-order requirements more explicitly than any other NC plan. Clinically it\'s straight CCP 8F — but its documentation bar is where referrals get screened out.',

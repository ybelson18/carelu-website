    intro: [
      'Nebraska Medicaid covers ABA for members under 21 through EPSDT, under a pair of Medicaid Service Definitions (MSDs) effective February 7, 2025 — and delivers it entirely through Heritage Health managed care, so every authorization runs through one of three MCOs: Nebraska Total Care, Molina, or UnitedHealthcare Community Plan (with ABA managed by Optum). Two things make Nebraska unusual. First, an autism diagnosis is not strictly required — a developmental or intellectual disability qualifies when the ABA assessment establishes need. Second, in August 2025 DHHS cut ABA rates roughly 28–79% by code after program spend exploded from $4.6M to $85M+ in four years, making Nebraska one of the lowest-paying ABA states in the country. Both facts should shape how a practice runs intake here.',

That makes Nebraska one of the states where intake should not turn away a family without an autism diagnosis: ask about developmental and intellectual disability diagnoses too. The gate that does apply universally is the Initial Diagnostic Interview: an IDI by a licensed clinician, completed within the previous 12 months, must establish the need for the ABA assessment (with an IDI addendum if the clinical presentation has changed). One additional carve-out worth knowing: DD-waiver recipients may receive ABA assessments (97151/97152) regardless of age, and even for non-ABA purposes — effective 7/1/2026, per DHHS Provider Bulletin 26-06, which directly confirms this rule (previously sourced here only by inference).',

The current schedule per 15-minute unit: 97151 assessment $38.16, 97153 direct treatment $18.70, 97155 protocol modification $22.72, 97156 family training $26.06 (also 97152 $25.88, 97154 $7.49, 97158 $12.05).

The cuts triggered a legislative interim study, a State Auditor attestation report, and the near-exit of the state\'s largest provider — but they remain fully in force: the SFY27 fee schedule effective July 1, 2026 carries the same numbers. DHHS also directs the Heritage Health MCOs to track this fee schedule (HPA 25-08), so there is no MCO rate refuge.

This guide previously tied that change to Provider Bulletin 26-06 via local reporting it could not independently confirm; DHHS Provider Bulletin 26-06 ("Updated Service Definition and Changes to Billing and Utilization of Applied Behavior Analysis Services," dated June 1, 2026, effective July 1, 2026, signed by DHHS Director Drew Gonshorowski) has since been located and read directly, and it confirms the change firsthand: the 2026 updated ABA MSDs carrying the clean 20-hour/week language (no 30-hour alternate) took effect July 1, 2026, following a provider-feedback period. DHHS\'s public-facing "ABA Facts" summary page has not caught up: it still describes the policy as allowing up to 30 hours per week (reconfirmed stale as of this review), so expect that page to read stale until DHHS updates it.

          'At the technician level, Nebraska is now a pure-BACB state. Under the treatment MSD, the only staff who may deliver 97153/97154 under a licensed clinician are RBTs with current BACB certification or Licensed assistant Behavior Analysts (LaBAs) — and PB 25-02 dropped the state\'s longstanding bachelor\'s-degree-plus-experience requirement for RBTs, leaving BACB certification plus individual Nebraska Medicaid enrollment (RBT is its own provider type, 85, on the fee schedule) as the whole state requirement. There is no state technician registry and no training hours beyond the BACB floor — which itself requires each RBT applicant to pass both a criminal background check and an abuse-registry check within 180 days of applying, attested by a certificant.',
          'Nebraska\'s enrollment screening is lighter on ABA than agencies often assume. Provider types are risk-tiered per 42 CFR 455: BCBA (type 83) screens at Moderate risk (federal database checks plus unannounced site visits), while BCaBA (84) and RBT (85) screen at Limited — no fingerprint-based criminal background check at enrollment unless a trigger (payment suspension for a credible fraud allegation, a $1,500+ overpayment, an exclusion within 10 years) escalates the provider to High risk. The registry checks that trip up multi-line agencies bind elsewhere: the annual Child/Adult Abuse and Neglect Central Registry, Sex Offender Registry, and NDEN checks attach to individual HCBS (waiver/PAS) and NEMT providers, not ABA provider types 83–85 — so for a standard ABA practice, abuse-registry screening reaches staff through the BACB\'s own 180-day check rather than a state mandate. Two caveats: DHHS states that enrolled providers "should also be screening their employees based on the services they provide," and an agency that also delivers waiver service lines inherits the HCBS checks for those staff.',
          'Supervision is where the staffing math binds. Since January 1, 2025, every Medicaid-serving BCBA must hold a Nebraska LBA license and every BCaBA a LaBA license under the Behavior Analyst Practice Act (Neb. Rev. Stat. §§ 38-4401 to 38-4414, with BACB certification as the licensure floor) — note the practice-act regulations (172 NAC 10) were still in draft on the DHHS licensure page, so confirm current application mechanics with the Licensure Unit. The MSD\'s floors: direct observation of each technician for no less than 10% of weekly direct-service hours, documented in progress notes (PB 25-02 describes required supervision as 10–20% — the same kind of document conflict as the hour caps, so staff to the higher reading for margin), at least 1 hour per month of in-person observation of each technician or LaBA, and no more than 24 technicians per LBA. Plan-level extras: since January 1, 2025 all three Heritage Health MCOs run credentialing through a single CVO, Verisys; Nebraska Total Care adds a credentialing application (or CAQH authorization), malpractice face sheet, five-year work history, cultural-competency training evidence, and re-credentialing at least every 36 months; and Optum (UHC\'s ABA network) layers staff-level rules on groups — supervising BCBAs with BACB supervisory certification, RBT (or equivalent national) certification for technicians, and $1M/$3M professional liability coverage.',

The treatment plan must include hours requested per service with clinical justification, billing codes, a titration/discharge plan, a crisis plan, and documented coordination-of-care attempts down to dates, success, and contact names. On the front end, NE.CP.BH.105 requires the behavior identification assessment package to include the IDI and a functional behavior assessment with direct assessment and data analysis. One honest gap: we did not locate a published NTC statement that the assessment CPT codes themselves require PA — verify the assessment-PA question in the portal or with the plan before booking, rather than assuming either way.',

No visit limits or less-favorable dollar limits or cost-sharing are otherwise permitted, non-BHT payments (OT/ST/PT, pharmacy, psychiatric care) cannot be applied against the cap, and the insurer may review treatment at most once every 6 months, at its own cost. ABA must be provided or supervised by a nationally certified behavior analyst or licensed psychologist, in person or by telehealth. The reach is narrower than it reads: the statute exempts non-grandfathered individual and small-group ACA plans required to include essential health benefits, so the mandate\'s practical territory is large-group and grandfathered plans — and while the statute\'s text reaches self-funded plans "to the extent not preempted," ERISA preemption still takes self-funded employer plans off the table.

The practical consequences for intake: never route an ABA eligibility or authorization question to an MCO (Aetna Better Health, Priority Partners, MedStar, Wellpoint, or any of the nine); run benefits checks against Medicaid eligibility and Carelon, not the plan on the card; and expect parents to be confused by this — the MCO card is what they hold, but for ABA it\'s irrelevant.

Only then can a psychologist, BCBA-D, or BCBA complete the 97151 assessment and treatment plan.

          'Maryland\'s defining staffing rule: every individual who renders ABA — psychologist, BCBA-D, BCBA, BCaBA, RBT, and even not-yet-certified BTs — enrolls with Maryland Medicaid individually through ePREP, on top of the group\'s own enrollment. The technician floor is codified in state regulation, not just BACB policy: under COMAR 10.09.28.02, an RBT must be 18 or older, hold current BACB registration, hold a high school diploma or national equivalent (a copy attaches to the ePREP application), and work under a documented supervisory relationship with a licensed psychologist, licensed BCBA-D, or licensed BCBA. There is no separate Maryland RBT license or state technician registry — the binding credential is BACB certification plus individual Medicaid enrollment. The pre-certification BT on-ramp (specialty code 325, license number \'BT\', 90-day expiration) covered above has one hiring trap: the 90-day grace period attaches to the person, not your company — a BT who used part of it at a prior employer doesn\'t restart the clock with you. Underneath all of this sits the BACB\'s own floor: RBT applicants must pass a criminal background check and abuse-registry check within 180 days of paying for the certification application, confirmed by the RBT Supervisor or Requirements Coordinator, and effective January 1, 2026 the 40-hour training must follow the updated 2026 curriculum, delivered by active BCBAs/BCaBAs who\'ve completed the BACB\'s 8-hour supervision training.',
          'State screening runs through two instruments, and both are yours to manage. First, the CJIS criminal background check: COMAR 10.09.28.02 makes a completed Criminal Justice Information System background check a condition of participation for the group and each enrolled individual — it\'s completed as part of ePREP enrollment, using the CJIS Private Party Petition form from the Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services (DPSCS). There\'s no separate fingerprint clearance card system for ABA staff; fingerprint-based CHRC obligations attach to licensure applicants (behavior analysts), while unlicensed staff clear through Medicaid enrollment. Second, ongoing exclusion screening: the provider manual makes agencies responsible for OIG exclusion checks of ALL staff who touch the Medicaid program — direct service or administrative support — every 30 days, with documentation maintained; failure to screen is subject to disciplinary action. Enrolled providers must also be sanction-free — no current sanctions or disciplinary actions from licensing authorities, Medicare, Maryland Medical Assistance, or other federally funded programs.',
          'At the supervisor tier, Maryland has required licensure since January 2015: anyone practicing behavior analysis needs a Licensed Behavior Analyst (LBA) license from the Board of Professional Counselors and Therapists — current BCBA/BCBA-D certification, a master\'s or higher from a BACB-accredited/approved program, and a criminal history records check obtained before applying; the license renews every 2 years with a fresh CHRC at each renewal (and the board moves to online-only applications June 20, 2026). For Medicaid, supervisors need both the LBA license and current BACB certification (a licensed psychologist with the ABA attestation is the alternative). The supervision floors that bind your staffing model: direction of a technician (BCaBA/RBT/BT) must equal at least 10% of the technician\'s direct-service hours AND be performed in person at least 25% of the time (COMAR 10.09.28.04) — with remote direction requiring MDH or BHASO approval, and 0362T requiring the supervisor onsite. The BACB\'s 5%-monthly RBT supervision minimum (two face-to-face contacts, one individual) layers underneath. One structural mercy: because ABA runs through a single BHASO, there is no plan-by-plan credentialing — enroll each person via ePREP (applications reviewed by MDH, not the ASO), then register once with Carelon for ProviderConnect/Availity access; Carelon publishes no separate staff-credentialing standard beyond the state\'s, though it does require sentinel-event reporting (including any sexual activity between a staff member and a participant) within 24 hours.',

      { q: 'Does UnitedHealthcare cover ABA therapy in Maryland?', a: 'Yes — under Optum\'s national two-step authorization policy for ASD, and for fully-insured Maryland plans Optum\'s own State Mandates document applies the COMAR 31.10.39.03 criteria, including the 25 and 10 hour/week no-denial floors. Self-funded employer plans follow the standard national policy instead.' },
      { q: 'What does the Maryland mandate require for ABA?', a: 'For fully-insured plans: habilitative-services coverage through at least the month the enrollee turns 19, no denial of ABA solely on prescribed hours up to 25 hrs/week (ages 18 months–5) or 10 hrs/week (ages 6–18), no experimental/investigational denials, and no dollar cap — entered via a comprehensive evaluation plus a physician prescription reviewed annually. Optum reproduces these criteria in its own published document.' },
      { q: 'What does UnitedHealthcare pay for ABA in Maryland?', a: 'Commercial ABA rates are not published — they are negotiated in your participating-provider agreement. Benchmark against Maryland Medicaid\'s February 2026 fee schedule and treat rate-setting as part of contracting.' },

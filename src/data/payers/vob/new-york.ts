/* ================================================================
   VOB ENRICHMENT — New York, split B: upstate Medicaid MCOs +
   commercial (Aetna, Cigna, UnitedHealthcare). Layers 1 (EDI routing
   crosswalk) + 3 (code-level coverage grid). See docs/vob-build.md.
   Layer 4 (Medicaid rates) is deliberately NOT populated for any
   guide in this split: none of the 5 upstate MCOs publish their own
   ABA rate schedule (the state eMedNY fee schedule is FFS-only and
   explicitly does not bind MMC plans — "MMC plans negotiate their
   own rates," per the eMedNY ABA Policy Manual as summarized in the
   new-york-medicaid guide), and commercial rates are out of scope by
   spec. A sibling change-set covers new-york-medicaid + downstate
   MCOs in this same file — this split ONLY touches the 8 slugs
   below; never edit another slug's block.

   Sourcing notes (read before editing):
   - pVerify and Availity payer IDs below come from live extraction
     of the same two public payer-list PDFs cited throughout this
     corpus (pverify.com All-Payers-List and Availity Essentials
     payer_list_wShortNames), re-fetched and parsed to a structured
     table this pass (both PDFs defeat naive text extraction — they
     render as column-separated blocks without table parsing — so
     confirm against the source PDF directly if re-verifying by eye).
   - Of the 5 upstate MCOs, only Excellus, Independent Health, and
     UnitedHealthcare/Aetna/Cigna resolve to a single unambiguous
     pVerify ID; MVP and Highmark WNY had a Medicaid-specific line
     item captured directly (MVP's general ID cross-confirmed against
     its own Payee ID 14165 cited in its Provider Policies document;
     Highmark's Medicaid-and-CHP line is pVerify's own explicit
     label). CDPHP has two unresolved candidate IDs. NONE of the 5
     upstate MCOs, and neither Excellus/CDPHP/Independent
     Health/Highmark, appear at all in the fetched Availity payer
     list — flagged per-guide as unverified rather than guessed.
   - UnitedHealthcare's Optum Behavioral Health carve-out payer ID
     (UHG007, pVerify) and Cigna's Evernorth same-ID pass-through
     (62308, Availity + Cigna's own Autism Resource Guide) both
     resolve cleanly. Aetna's BH administration in New York remains
     unconfirmed — no NY-specific Aetna document names one, matching
     this corpus's Georgia finding for the same payer.
   - Code-grid mechanics (unit caps, POS codes, billing modifiers) are
     largely 'unverified' for the 5 MCOs: unlike Georgia, New York's
     own FFS ABA Policy Manual doesn't publish billing modifiers or
     per-code POS numbers either (confirmed by re-reading the
     new-york-medicaid guide's own sourced sections) — so the absence
     here reflects the state's own documentation style, not a gap in
     this pass's research. Where a plan states something concrete
     (MVP's Medicaid-specific 0362T/0373T exclusion and school-setting
     bar; Highmark's $45,000/year cap and named telehealth codes;
     Excellus's/CDPHP's/Independent Health's named code lists or
     service categories) it is carried over verified from the guide
     prose's own already-cited primary sources.
   - Commercial codeGrid entries mirror this corpus's Georgia findings
     for Aetna/Cigna/UnitedHealthcare (none of the three publish
     code-level unit caps, POS codes, or modifiers in their national
     clinical policies) with New York's mandate specifics — the
     no-ABA-only-visit-limits rule (the 680-hour cap was repealed
     effective 1/1/2020) and the LBA-only delivery requirement — layered on
     as notes, since DFS Circular Letter 6 and NYSED Article 167 (both
     already cited in the guide prose) verify them for New York
     directly.

   VOB ENRICHMENT — Ohio, Layers 1 (EDI routing crosswalk), 3
   (code-level coverage grid), and 4 (Medicaid rate tables). See
   docs/vob-build.md for the spec.

   Sourcing notes (read before editing):
   - HIGH-VALUE FIND: the ODM Next Generation program's Fiscal
     Intermediary (Gainwell Technologies) publishes a 5010 270/271
     companion guide, v13.0 dated 2023-06-30, retrievable directly from
     Ohio's asset CDN (dam.assets.ohio.gov) even though
     managedcare.medicaid.ohio.gov and the ODM companion-guide listing
     page both 404 to automated fetch. It documents the MCO-enrollment
     mechanics for the 271 in full: Loop 2110C EB01='MC' flags MCO
     enrollment, the MCO entity is named in Loop 2120C NM1 (NM101='PR'),
     EB05 carries the coded plan-coverage description, eligibility spans
     are MONTHLY (EB06='34'), and — critically for the OhioRISE landmine
     — the guide carries a FIXED ODM trading-partner code table (ISA06/
     ISA08) plus a 2100A NM109 MCE-payer-ID table that make each MCO,
     including Aetna OhioRISE, separately identifiable on the wire.
     medicaid271Notes on ohio-medicaid ships these as verified.
   - THE OHIORISE LANDMINE: OhioRISE (Aetna) IS separately visible in
     the 271 (trading-partner 0021914 / MCE claims payer ID 60054), but
     per ODM's Mixed Services Protocol OhioRISE NEVER pays ABA — the
     member's medical MCO (or FFS) does, even for OhioRISE-enrolled
     youth. The 271 shows OhioRISE enrollment; the ABA payer is the
     underlying MCO. This is encoded in the notes, not guessed.
   - THE FEE SCHEDULE IS A DRAFT: ODM's ABA fee appendix (per-15-min
     "current maximum payment amount") lives in the rule package
     ERF188422B.pdf, which is stamped "DRAFT - NOT YET FILED" on every
     rule page and moves the fee schedule from 5160-34-02 to a new
     5160-34-03 Appendix A (the draft removes 5160-34-02). It is the
     only published ODM ABA fee document and is what the existing
     ohio.ts prose already quotes — the rates below are transcribed
     verbatim from that draft appendix with the draft status flagged and
     the effective-date column shown as blank, NOT presented as an
     in-force schedule. codes.ohio.gov (in-force OAC 5160-34 text) is
     JS/bot-gated and could not be read this pass.
   - PRICING IS BY PRACTITIONER TIER, NOT MODIFIER: the ODM appendix
     differentiates payment by practitioner-tier descriptor rows
     (Independent Adaptive Services Practitioner = COBA/BCBA/BCBA-D;
     BCaBA; RBT), with NO HN/HO/HM/TG modifier column. Whether ODM
     requires tier modifiers on claims is silent in the document —
     codeGrid modifiers ship accordingly (unverified, described).
   - PER-CODE DAILY CAPS: the in-force/draft state rule sets no per-code
     daily unit cap (only an assessment PA threshold of 10 hrs/180 days
     and a 1:8 group ratio). The per-code CMS NCCI MUE ceilings are
     enumerated verbatim in CareSource's PY-1638 (eff. 9/1/2026 — as of
     this pass, split out of MM-0028 into this new companion
     reimbursement policy, figures unchanged: 97151=32, 97152=16,
     97153=32, 97154=18, 97155=24, 97156=16, 97157=16, 97158=16,
     0362T=16, 0373T=32) and are the operative federal daily ceiling —
     applied as 'verified' on the CareSource guide and 'inferred'
     elsewhere, with the state's own silence noted on ohio-medicaid.
   - THIS PASS (2026-09-01, targeted CareSource + OAC 5160-34 update
     only — not a full state re-verify): CareSource's MM-0028 (eff.
     7/1/2025) is now archived (stamped "Date Archived 08/31/2026");
     the successor MM-0028 (eff. 9/1/2026) plus new companion PY-1638
     (eff. 9/1/2026) were fetched and read in full — see
     CARESOURCE_MM0028 / CARESOURCE_PY1638. Separately, the
     codes.ohio.gov 5160-34 outage (flagged "cause undetermined" in
     prior passes) now has a documented, non-final cause — see
     ODM_ABA_OFFICE_HOURS.
   - BOT-BLOCK RETRIES: AmeriHealth Caritas Ohio's and Molina Ohio's
     provider pages, reported blocked in the original compile, are NOT
     currently blocked — both loaded this pass (AmeriHealth Caritas
     confirms ABA needs PA; Molina's page is member-facing with no
     code/EDI detail). Optum's Ohio Medicaid LOCG PDF and Anthem's
     CG-BEH-02 asset are JS-gated / not-locatable to automated fetch —
     those plans' per-code detail ships 'inferred'/'unverified' with a
     verifyVia, per "never guess."
   - The 3 commercial guides (aetna-ohio, cigna-ohio,
     unitedhealthcare-ohio) get Layers 1 + 3 only, per the build spec
     ("Do not attempt commercial rates"); their code grids reuse the
     already-verified national clinical policies (CPB 0554/0648, EN0499,
     Optum SCC/2022RP501A) as in the Georgia build, with Ohio's autism
     mandate (R.C. 3923.84) noted.

/* ==================== Layer 2 — STC interpretation maps ====================
   The ODM/Gainwell 5010 270/271 Companion Guide v13.0 (already fetched and
   cited above for medicaid271Notes' MCO-enrollment mechanics) documents
   Loop/segment mechanics for MCO enrollment (§6-7) but its service-type-code
   (STC) support table — which STCs (30, MH, A4-A8, etc.) the ODM 271 feed
   actually populates with financial detail — was not extracted this pass.
   None of the 7 MCOs' own cited sources (PA pages, clinical policies, the
   Carelon Anthem QRG) address STC support either. Per the "never guess"
   rule, ohio-medicaid and its 7 MCOs (which run their own PA/eligibility
   but publish no independently confirmed 270/271 STC support table) ship
   fully 'unverified' rather than inferred from the ODM companion guide's
   unrelated MCO-segment content or from another state's pattern. */

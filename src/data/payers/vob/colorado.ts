   VOB ENRICHMENT — Colorado, Layers 1 (EDI routing crosswalk),
   3 (code-level coverage grid) + 4 (Medicaid rate table).
   See docs/vob-build.md for the spec.

   Sourcing notes (read before editing):
   - Colorado ABA is the Pediatric Behavioral Therapies (PBT) EPSDT
     benefit and is a STATEWIDE FEE-FOR-SERVICE CARVE-OUT: the four
     Regional Accountable Entities (RAEs) administer the capitated
     behavioral-health benefit, but PBT is not in that capitation —
     every PAR goes to the state UM vendor Acentra (Atrezzo /
     ColoradoPAR.com) and every claim to the state fiscal agent
     (Gainwell), regardless of the member's RAE. bhCarveOut is
     therefore 'none' on the Medicaid guide (ABA rides the medical
     FFS claim, no second hop), and a RAE showing on the 271 does
     NOT redirect ABA. (Verified: HCPF PM 25-005, PBT Billing Manual;
     already-verified corpus prose in src/data/payers/colorado.ts.)
   - KNOWN OBSTACLE: hcpf.colorado.gov 403s every automated fetch.
     The PBT Billing Manual, PM 25-005, the FY2025-26 fee schedule
     (.xlsx) and Special Provider Bulletin B2500528 could not be
     retrieved live this pass. Where a fact traces only to those
     documents, provenance is stated on the field/source and the
     value is carried from the already-verified corpus prose (itself
     built from those primary sources) — see the rates.source string
     and per-field verifyVia. The Colorado interChange 270/271
     companion guide (Gainwell) could not be retrieved either, so
     medicaid271Notes ships 'unverified' per the "never guess" rule.
   - Colorado's PBT allowable-code table is a REDUCED CPT set:
     97151 (+ the 97151-TJ per-15-min variant), 97153, 97154, 97155,
     97158. 97156 (family/caregiver guidance) is NOT a billable code
     in Colorado — it is absent from the allowable-code table and has
     no rate. 97152, 97157, 0362T and 0373T are likewise not on the
     PBT allowable-code table. The codeGrid is keyed to Colorado's
     actual billable set, and the non-covered codes carry explicit
     'No' entries (a high-value intake fact), not the forced CPT list.
   - The four commercial guides (aetna/cigna/unitedhealthcare-colorado)
     run on the SAME national clinical policies as every other state
     (Aetna CPB 0554/0648; Evernorth/Cigna EN0499; Optum SCC +
     national ABA Reimbursement Policy). Their EDI IDs are national,
     not Colorado-specific; their codeGrid mechanics come from those
     national policies with the same gaps flagged in georgia.ts. What
     is Colorado-specific for commercial members is the C.R.S.
     10-16-104(1.4) mandate layer, which lives in the prose guide, not
     in these VOB layers.

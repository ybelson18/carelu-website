   VOB ENRICHMENT — Nebraska, Layers 1 (EDI routing crosswalk) + 3
   (code-level coverage grid) + 4 (Medicaid rate tables) + 7 (contact
   & channel layer). See docs/vob-build.md for the spec.

   Sourcing notes (read before editing):
   - Provider Bulletin 25-14 and the MHSUD fee schedule are PDFs/XLSX
     that a plain WebFetch could not render this pass (returned
     "corrupted binary" every time) — they were downloaded directly
     and parsed with pdfminer.six / openpyxl instead. The resulting
     rate figures were cross-checked against TWO independent primary
     documents (the bulletin's own table AND the fee schedule's "ABA"
     tab) and match exactly, so they carry fieldStatus 'verified'
     rather than 'inferred'.
   - The SFY27 fee-schedule URL nebraska.ts used to cite
     ("MHSUD SFY27 Fee Schedule.xlsx") 404s (re-confirmed 2026-09-27;
     nebraska.ts now cites the REVISED file) — DHHS's
     Provider Rates & Fee Schedules index page now serves it at a
     different filename, "REVISED MHSUD SFY27 Fee Schedule.xlsx".
     Both that file and the July 2025 interim schedule ("Mental
     Health and Substance July 1 2025 Updated 7.31.25.xlsx") were
     fetched directly and used here; the dead original URL is not
     cited below.
   - The fee schedule's "ABA" tab is the single richest coding-
     mechanics source found this pass: it gives, per code, a
     telehealth modifier + POS column (populated ONLY for 97151,
     97155, 97156 — blank for every other ABA code) and a per-
     provider-type rate matrix (columns 1=MD, 2=DO, 57=Provisionally
     Licensed PhD, 67=Licensed Psychologist, 83=BCBA/LBA, 84=BCaBA/
     LaBA, 85=RBT) where ineligible provider types are listed at a
     flat $0, not a lower nonzero rate. That is the primary source
     for this file's "credential differentiates who CAN bill a code,
     not what the eligible biller is PAID" framing, and it also
     independently confirms 97157, 0362T, and 0373T are simply absent
     from Nebraska's billable ABA code set (they have no row on this
     tab, no entry in Provider Bulletin 25-14, no mention on DHHS's
     "Applied Behavior Analysis Facts" page, and no entry in either
     ABA Medicaid Service Definition's own "Fee schedule codes for
     this service are" list) — treated here as a verified absence,
     not merely an unresearched gap.
   - Oddity flagged, not silently fixed: both ABA Medicaid Service
     Definitions (the treatment MSD AND the Behavior Identification
     Assessment MSD) list the IDENTICAL "Fee schedule codes for this
     service are: 97153, 97154, 97155, 97156, 97158" block verbatim —
     including in the assessment MSD, which is otherwise entirely
     about 97151/97152 and never mentions those five codes again.
     Read as a copy/paste artifact in DHHS's own PDF template, not
     evidence that assessment codes bill under those numbers.
   - The NE MMIS 270/271 Companion Guide (dhhs.ne.gov, effective date
     printed as 3/9/2015) was retrieved successfully and read in full
     — unlike Georgia's inaccessible GAMMIS guide, this one directly
     answers Layer 1's core questions. It carries staleRisk: true
     (11+ years old) for anything time-sensitive (e.g., help-desk
     phone numbers), but its 271 loop/segment content is structural
     EDI-standard mapping unlikely to have changed and is treated as
     verified. It documents NO numeric MCO carrier-code crosswalk —
     the member's MCO name is returned as free text (loop 2120C, NM1,
     entity identifier code "X3"), not a coded value — so
     mcoCarrierCodes is a verified EMPTY object, not an unresearched
     gap.
   - pVerify payer IDs below were extracted with pdfplumber's table
     parser (not the flattened text dump), because the source PDF's
     multi-column table lays out the ID/Name/Elig/Claims/ERA/LOB
     columns in separate text blocks that a naive line-order read
     cannot reliably re-associate — a raw-text WebFetch of this
     document mis-parsed or refused it entirely on every attempt this
     pass. Table-cell extraction gave clean, verifiable rows.
   - Availity's public payer list (same "As of 08/08/2012" stale
     snapshot already flagged in georgia.ts / aetna-florida) contains
     NO row at all for Nebraska Medicaid, Nebraska Total Care, Molina
     Healthcare of Nebraska, or UnitedHealthcare Community Plan of
     Nebraska — only an unrelated "Coventry Health Care - Nebraska"
     legacy line. Those four payerId.availity fields are therefore
     'unverified', not merely stale.
   - Aetna precertification form number: nebraska.ts's own prose (and
     the aetna-nebraska PayerConfig) cites "form GR-69017-4" for
     Aetna's national ABA precert. georgia.ts's independent QA
     re-check of the SAME two source CPBs (0554, 0648) found that
     form number does not actually appear in either document and
     removed it there. That correction is not repeated here — the
     aetna-nebraska codeGrid below does NOT assert the form number as
     a verified fact, flagging the cross-file tension explicitly
     instead of silently picking a side.
   - Commercial clinical/coding-mechanics facts (Aetna CPB 0554/0648,
     Cigna/Evernorth EN0499, Optum's national ABA Supplemental
     Clinical Criteria + Reimbursement Policy 2022RP501A) are NATIONAL
     policies with no Nebraska-specific overlay found in any of them
     (Optum's own ABA State Mandates supplement, BH803ABA, has no
     Nebraska entry — already noted in nebraska.ts prose). Their
     coding-mechanics content is therefore reused from the same
     documents georgia.ts already extracted, exactly as the build
     brief invited for shared national payer IDs.

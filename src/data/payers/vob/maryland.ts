/* ================================================================
   VOB ENRICHMENT — Maryland, Layers 1 (EDI routing crosswalk) + 3
   (code-level coverage grid) + 4 (Medicaid rate table). See
   docs/vob-build.md for the spec.

   Sourcing notes (read before editing):
   - The single most important finding in this file: Maryland's own
     270/271 companion guide (MDH, dated 2013 "Draft Version 2" — the
     ONLY version hosted, 13 years stale) contains ZERO references to
     "BHASO," "Carelon," "Beacon," "ValueOptions," or any behavioral-
     health administrator anywhere in its 22 pages. Loop 2120C NM1
     (NM101=1P/FA/PRP) carries only an MCO name, Facility name, or
     Primary Payer name. A plain 270/271 against Maryland Medicaid's
     MMIS therefore does NOT surface the ABA/BH carve-out at all —
     there is no discoverable EDI signal telling a clearinghouse to
     route ABA to Carelon instead of the HealthChoice MCO on the
     card. That routing has to be hard-coded business logic (which
     this file encodes via bhCarveOut + twoHopRequired: true), not
     something a 271 parser can detect on its own.
   - Carelon became Maryland's BHASO only recently — January 1, 2025
     (succeeding Optum, which had run the state's Public Behavioral
     Health System before that). MDH's own Provider Transmittal
     PT 54-25 (Dec 16, 2024) states the Carelon "submitter ID" is
     BHOMD (superseding Optum-era OMDBH), confirmed independently by
     Claim.MD's clearinghouse payer registry ("Additional IDs:
     OMDBH"). That transmittal is written for the Health Homes
     program specifically — no ABA-specific MDH transmittal naming
     BHOMD was found this pass, so administratorPayerId ships
     'inferred' (same BHASO/PBHS umbrella), not 'verified', pending a
     document that names BHOMD for ABA claims specifically.
   - pVerify's payer-list page (pverify.com/payer-list/) returned a
     literal Cloudflare bot-block page on direct retrieval this pass
     — any pVerify-sourced number for a Maryland guide is therefore
     'unverified' throughout this file, not silently filled from an
     unverifiable scrape.
   - Real-time-vs-batch for the Carelon/BHOMD hop: Carelon's own
     national 270-271 companion guide states verbatim "At present,
     Carelon does not support real-time Eligibility Benefit Inquiry
     and Response transactions" (batch only). That guide is generic/
     national, not Maryland-specific, so supportsRealtime for the
     BHOMD hop ships 'inferred' from that statement, not verified
     against a Maryland-specific Carelon companion guide (none found).
   - Aetna/Cigna/UnitedHealthcare commercial code-level billing
     mechanics (unit caps, POS, modifiers) are NOT Maryland-specific
     in any source found for Georgia either — these three carriers
     publish clinical-necessity policy nationally and defer coding
     detail to reimbursement policies that don't carry state
     overrides. Entries below reuse the same national source
     documents (CPB 0554/0648, EN0499, Optum SCC + Reimbursement
     Policy) already verified in vob/georgia.ts — legitimately the
     same documents, not duplicated research.

/* ================================================================
   VOB ENRICHMENT — Kansas, Layers 1 (EDI routing crosswalk) + 3
   (code-level coverage grid) + 4 (Medicaid rate tables). See
   docs/vob-build.md for the spec. Scope for this state: Medicaid
   lines only for Layer 4 (kansas-medicaid + its three KanCare MCOs)
   — commercial guides (aetna-kansas, cigna-kansas,
   unitedhealthcare-kansas) ship Layers 1+3 only.

   Sourcing notes (read before editing):
   - Kansas doesn't bill ABA under the standard CPT set. KanCare's
     autism benefit (CCTS + IIS under EPSDT) uses a subset: 97151,
     97152, 97155, 97156 were billable from the 1/1/2017 State Plan
     transition; 97153, 97154, and 97158 became additionally billable
     effective 7/1/2024 (per kansas.ts guide prose). 97157 and the
     Category III codes (0362T/0373T) are NOT part of Kansas's
     billable set — per the build spec's explicit instruction, this
     codeGrid ships exactly that 7-code set for kansas-medicaid,
     sunflower-health-plan-kansas, unitedhealthcare-community-plan-
     kansas, and healthy-blue-kansas, not the full CPT list forced
     from other states. Commercial KS guides (Aetna/Cigna/UHC) DO use
     the standard 10-code CPT set, since commercial ABA billing isn't
     tied to the KanCare CCTS/IIS structure.
   - The actual KMAP 270/271 Standard Companion Guide WAS located and
     is machine-readable this pass — not via the portal.kmap-state-
     ks.us public page (which redirects to an OAM/SSO login wall for
     every attempt, consistent with prior VOB-build sessions'
     experience with KMAP/BSRB portals), but via a direct document URL
     on the legacy www.kmap-state-ks.us host. It is Version 6.0, dated
     May 2, 2017 — the document itself states no later companion-guide
     revision exists in the 270/271 line, so this ships with
     staleRisk:true (>18 months old) rather than being treated as
     current, per the freshness rule. It gives the Loop 2110C /
     EB03=30 managed-care segment location but — like Georgia and
     Indiana — no numeric carrier-code table; MCOs are identified by a
     free-text EB05 description only.
   - Kansas Medicaid rates for the State Plan CCTS/IIS 9715x codes
     remain genuinely unverified beyond a stale 2019 anchor — this
     matches kansas.ts's own guide prose ("we won't quote current
     Kansas autism-services rates, because we couldn't verify them").
     This pass re-attempted the watchlist: the KMAP interactive fee
     lookup redirects to the same SSO wall as the companion-guide
     portal, and the FY2024/FY2025/FY2026 HCBS rate-increase bulletins
     (checked directly) cover only Brain Injury / Technology Assisted
     / I-DD HCBS waiver services plus the separate HCBS Autism waiver
     code T2040 — NOT the State Plan CCTS/IIS 9715x codes. No more-
     current State Plan rate was found. Layer 4 therefore ships mostly
     'unverified' for Kansas, which is the honest per-spec answer, not
     an incomplete pass.
   - National commercial payer IDs (Aetna 00001/60054, Cigna
     00004/62308, UnitedHealthcare 00192/87726) are reused verbatim
     from georgia.ts/indiana.ts: the SAME national pVerify/Availity
     entries, re-confirmed by direct re-fetch this pass.

/* ==================== Layer 2 — STC interpretation maps ====================
   kansas-medicaid + its 3 KanCare MCOs: the KMAP 270/271 Standard Companion
   Guide (Version 6.0, May 2, 2017 — KMAP_COMPANION_GUIDE above) documents the
   managed-care segment location (Loop 2110C/EB03=30, see edi section) but
   publishes no service-type-code (STC) support table — which STCs KMAP
   actually populates with financial detail for ABA-relevant benefit buckets
   (30/MH/A4/A6) is not stated anywhere in the retrieved document, and the
   interactive fee-schedule/EDI portal redirects to the same OAM/SSO wall
   documented elsewhere in this file. None of the 3 MCOs (Sunflower, UHC
   Community Plan, Healthy Blue) publish their own 270/271 companion guide
   or STC table either. Per the "never guess" rule and consistent with the
   same gap already documented for georgia-medicaid/its CMOs (georgia.ts) and
   colorado-medicaid (colorado.ts), this ships fully 'unverified' for all 4
   Medicaid-line guides. Kansas EPSDT/CCTS/IIS benefits are plausibly $0
   member cost-share (as is typical for EPSDT programs nationally, and per
   docs/vob-build.md Layer 2's instruction to check src/data/payers/kansas.ts
   first) — but that file's own prose and cites document only the COMMERCIAL
   K.S.A. 40-2,194 mandate's premium/hour-cap mechanics, not a Medicaid

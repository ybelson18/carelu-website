/* ================================================================
   VOB ENRICHMENT — Utah, Layers 1 (EDI routing crosswalk),
   3 (code-level coverage grid) + 4 (Medicaid rate table).
   See docs/vob-build.md for the spec.

   Sourcing notes (read before editing):
   - Utah ABA is the state-plan Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)
     benefit and is a FEE-FOR-SERVICE CARVE-OUT: the four physical-
     health ACOs (Health Choice Utah, Healthy U, Molina, SelectHealth
     Community Care) never administer ABA — diagnosis documentation,
     prior authorization, and claims all go directly to Utah Medicaid
     (PRISM), whatever card the family carries. UnitedHealthcare holds
     NO Utah Medicaid ACO contract; United Behavioral Health (Optum)
     appears only as a Prepaid Mental Health Plan (PMHP) contractor,
     and PMHPs cover MH/SUD only — ABA is carved out to state FFS.
     bhCarveOut is therefore 'none' on the Medicaid guide (ABA rides
     the medical FFS claim, no second hop), and an ACO/PMHP showing on
     the 271 does NOT redirect ABA. (Verified: Utah Medicaid ASD
     provider manual + family FAQ; already-verified corpus prose in
     src/data/payers/utah.ts.)
   - Utah is one of the most intake-friendly Medicaid programs:
     NO PA on 97151 (behavior-identification assessment — 1 per
     26 weeks, up to 24 units); treatment codes need PA in 26-week
     periods via PRISM with a 10-BUSINESS-DAY grace to submit after
     starting services; coverage runs 'regardless of age' (PRISM
     shows ages 1+, adult plans included).
   - KNOWN OBSTACLE: Utah's ASD provider manual + family FAQ PDFs
     returned unreadable binary to previous fetchers. Rate/cap/PA
     facts are carried from the already-verified corpus prose (itself
     built from the PRISM Coverage/Reimbursement lookup, the archived
     ASD manual, and SPA UT-25-0007) and each source is cited with a
     retrieval note. The Utah Medicaid 270/271 companion guide
     (PRISM / fiscal agent) could not be retrieved this pass, so
     medicaid271Notes ships 'unverified' per the "never guess" rule.
   - The three commercial guides (aetna/cigna/unitedhealthcare-utah)
     run on the SAME national clinical policies as every other state
     (Aetna CPB 0554/0648; Evernorth/Cigna EN0499; Optum SCC +
     national ABA Reimbursement Policy). Their EDI IDs are national,
     not Utah-specific; their codeGrid mechanics come from those
     national policies with the same gaps flagged in georgia.ts. What
     is Utah-specific for commercial members is the Utah Code
     31A-22-642 mandate layer (individual + large group only — NOT
     small group), which lives in the prose guide, not in these VOB
     layers.

/* ==================== Layer 2 — STC interpretation maps ====================
   utah-medicaid's own 270/271 companion guide (UT_PRISM_COMPANION_GUIDE,
   already cited above in utahMedicaidEdi.medicaid271Notes and fetched/text-
   extracted this pass) states plainly that Utah Medicaid "does not return
   eligibility at the procedure code level" and defaults to the generic STC
   "30" bucket — a real, guide-specific fact, not an inferred family pattern.
   That single fact (abaBenefitBucket + quality271Score) ships 'verified';
   nothing in that companion guide (an EDI/transaction-format document) or
   elsewhere in this file's sources addresses member cost-sharing mechanics
   (deductible/copay/coinsurance/OOP-max) for ABA specifically, so those
   fields ship honestly 'unverified' rather than assumed from general
   Medicaid cost-sharing norms. (Checked src/data/payers/utah.ts for a
   documented EPSDT/cost-share figure per docs/vob-build.md's guidance —
   the only related fact there is that Utah's ASD benefit is not an
   EPSDT child-only benefit; no $0/cost-share amount is stated, so nothing
   is carried forward.)

   select-health-utah (SelectHealth Community Care, Utah Medicaid's largest
   MCO) inherits utah-medicaid's own stcMap rather than shipping a fresh
   unverified map or the commercial family defaults: this guide's own
   edi.bhCarveOut.administrator and verifyVia notes above already document
   that ABA is carved out of Select Health entirely to Utah Medicaid FFS —
   Select Health does not adjudicate ABA for Community Care members at all,
   and an eligibility check for those members should route to utah-medicaid's
   own entry (pVerify 01324), not Select Health's payer ID. That is an even
   more centralized arrangement than Texas's shared-TMHP-feed MCO pattern
   (see texas.ts txMcoInferredStc), so the same inheritFamilyStc mechanism
   applies here, keyed off utahMedicaidStc instead of a commercial family
   default. */

   VOB ENRICHMENT — North Carolina SPLIT A, Layers 1 (EDI routing
   crosswalk) + 3 (code-level coverage grid) + 4 (Medicaid rate
   tables). See docs/vob-build.md for the spec. Covers the state
   Medicaid FFS guide and its 4 remaining Standard Plans:
   north-carolina-medicaid, healthy-blue-north-carolina,
   amerihealth-caritas-north-carolina, carolina-complete-health,
   unitedhealthcare-community-plan-north-carolina, plus the merged
   wellcare-north-carolina guide (kept for historical/routing
   reference). NC Tailored Plans + commercial guides are a sibling
   session's slugs in this SAME file — do not touch them.

   Sourcing notes (read before editing):
   - The NCTracks 270/271 Companion Guide (ASC X12N005010X279A1,
     version April 2025) was located and read in full — unlike
     Georgia's, this one IS a static, fetchable PDF. It documents a
     PLAN-TYPE code table (Appendix A, 2110C EB05) — Standard Plan,
     Tailored Plan, Carve-out, Health Choice variants, etc. — not a
     per-MCO carrier-name table. The specific MCO's identity/contact
     comes back dynamically in the 2120C NM1/PER loop, not from a
     fixed code list. This distinction is captured verbatim in
     medicaid271Notes rather than forced into a false MCO-name table.
   - MONTHLY REFRESH (access date 2026-09-01, see
     REFRESH_ACCESS_DATE_202609): the Clinical Coverage Policy 8F
     rewrite directed by HB 696 has been FINALIZED and PUBLISHED,
     effective August 1, 2026 (Amended Date: August 1, 2026) — opened
     directly at the new working URL (CCP_8F_CURRENT), corroborated by
     NC Medicaid's 8/31/2026 bulletin (NC_MEDICAID_8F_BULLETIN_083126,
     which itself supersedes an 8/5/2026 version of the same bulletin).
     This supersedes the prior pass's "still unpublished/pending" note
     below the access date it describes (NC_MEDICAID_8F_BLOG_072126,
     now kept only as the historical pre-rewrite baseline). Its
     Attachment A billing-code table still lists ONLY 97151-97157 —
     97158, 0362T, and 0373T do NOT appear anywhere in NC Medicaid's
     RB-BHT code set, unchanged by the rewrite. Per the "don't force
     the CPT list" rule, those three codes ship as explicit 'not
     covered' entries below rather than being silently omitted or
     filled with invented caps. Newly codified this cycle: telehealth
     removed entirely for 97152/97153/97154; 97155 telehealth capped
     at 50% (not the 20% some 7/2026 reporting described) of billing
     per beneficiary per 180 days; RBT/ABAT's 120-day certification
     grace period now confirmed to run from 8/1/2026 for EXISTING
     uncertified paraprofessionals too, not just new hires, with
     non-reimbursement of non-certified paraprofessionals' claims
     after the window; out-of-state LQASP/C-QP enrollment closes
     8/2/2026; and existing prior authorizations are confirmed
     unaffected by the move to a 90-day cadence for plans above 16
     hours/week (future reauthorizations only).
   - HB 696 (Session Law 2026-1) was read from the ratified bill text
     directly. Its ABA provisions (§3C.18) are effective on enactment
     — April 30, 2026 — NOT August 1, 2026 for the STATUTE itself; the
     CCP 8F policy rewrite it directed is what took effect 8/1/2026
     (see the monthly-refresh note above). No primary source ties any
     ABA rate change to 8/1/2026.
   - No plan among Healthy Blue, AmeriHealth Caritas, or Carolina
     Complete Health publishes its own code-level unit caps, POS
     codes, or modifiers for RB-BHT — each defers wholesale to CCP 8F,
     confirmed by reading their own UM guides/manuals/checklists
     directly (AmeriHealth's UM Guide literally cites "8F. (ncdhhs.gov)"
     in place of restating anything). WellCare of NC's WNC.CP.109 is
     the one plan-authored document with an actual CPT/modifier grid
     (GT video, KX audio-only for 97156/97157) — kept as historical
     reference per the plan's 4/1/2026 merger into Carolina Complete
     Health. UnitedHealthcare Community Plan NC's Optum-run ABA
     program QRG has zero code-level detail; Optum's national ABA
     Modifier FAQ (HN/HO/HM/HP tiers) is explicitly scoped to
     "commercial members only" and is NOT applied here as if it
     covered NC Medicaid.
   - EDI payer IDs surfaced a real, repeated pattern: several
     clearinghouses assign DIFFERENT codes for claims vs. 270/271
     real-time eligibility vs. ERA for the same payer (Healthy Blue,
     AmeriHealth Caritas NC). Each is captured with its own
     verifyVia note rather than collapsed into one number.
   - Carolina Complete Health's WellCare-merger routing mechanics are
     unusually well-documented: the unified payer ID (68069) and the
     legacy WellCare-only codes (PCS 23937, HHCS 57538) come straight
     from the plan's own merger page, including its explicit warning
     that pre-4/1/2026 WellCare claims submitted to CCH's ID reject
     with "Mbr not valid on DOS."

/* ================================================================
   VOB ENRICHMENT — North Carolina SPLIT B: Tailored Plans (Alliance,
   Trillium, Vaya, Partners) + commercial (Aetna, Cigna, UnitedHealthcare).
   Layers 1 (EDI crosswalk) + 3 (code grid) + 4 (rate tables, Tailored
   Plans only — commercial rates are contract-specific and excluded
   per docs/vob-build.md). NC Medicaid Direct + the five Standard
   Plans are a separate change-set (SPLIT A) landing in this same
   file/export from a parallel session — see the merge note on
   `northCarolinaVob` below.

   Sourcing notes (read before editing):
   - NC Medicaid's actual RB-BHT billable code set under Clinical
     Coverage Policy 8F is 97151-97157 ONLY. The 8F PDF's own
     telehealth-eligibility table (Attachment A) stops at 97157; no
     97158, 0362T, or 0373T appears in 8F, in Alliance's or Trillium's
     posted rate schedules, or in Vaya's authorization guidelines or
     rate schedule. This was verified by direct retrieval and text
     extraction of all four documents (not assumed) — codeGrid entries
     for those three CPT/HCPCS codes are marked "not part of NC's CCP
     8F billable code set" rather than invented. 99366 was checked and
     is likewise absent from 8F's code table.
   - None of Alliance Health, Trillium Health Resources, Vaya Health, or
     Partners Health Management appear under their own name on either
     the pVerify March-2026 payer list or the Availity Essentials 837
     payer list (both fetched and full-text-searched this pass, not
     skimmed) — nor does NC Medicaid itself appear on Availity's list.
     This is a structural fact, not a gap in this pass: Tailored Plan
     eligibility for RB-BHT most likely resolves through NC Medicaid's
     own 271 (NCTracks), with Tailored Plan enrollment surfacing as an
     MCO segment inside that response — the same mechanism the state-
     Medicaid guide's medicaid271Notes covers (a parallel session's
     scope, not populated here). Each Tailored Plan's own claims/EDI
     documentation was used instead where it exists.
   - Vaya's provider-document library, reported bot-blocked in the
     original corpus compile, was retried this pass and is NOT
     blocked: both its RB-BHT Authorization Guidelines v2.0 (Sept 2025)
     and its RB-BHT Guidance (May 2025) are plain-text PDFs that
     extracted cleanly. What remains genuinely unverified for Vaya is
     a *current* (FY26-27-cycle) rate schedule — the only rate
     document found is dated 7/1/2024 and one of its rates (97156)
     conflicts with the current statewide figure Alliance and Trillium
     both post; see the Vaya rates block below for the conflict detail.
   - Partners' payer ID 68069, which surfaces in several search hits
     and in the Partners/Carolina Complete Health FAQ, is confirmed by
     that same FAQ to be Carolina Complete Health's payer ID for
     PHYSICAL health claims delegated to CCH under the Tailored-Plan/
     Centene infrastructure arrangement (Availity list independently
     confirms 68069 = "Centene Corporation") — NOT a behavioral-health
     or RB-BHT payer ID. Partners' own BH claims route through
     ProAuth/Alpha+ with no clearinghouse payer ID found this pass;
     shipped 'unverified' rather than reusing 68069, which would be
     wrong.
   - Cigna/Evernorth's carve-out is the same national, already-verified
     same-payer-ID pass-through documented in the Georgia build (Cigna's
     own Autism Resource Guide states "Use Evernorth payer ID 62308").
     UnitedHealthcare's Optum BH routing has real NC-specific evidence
     this pass, via the (Medicaid) UHC Community Plan of NC ABA Quick
     Reference Guide: "Claims Payer ID 87726" (same as UHC's medical
     payer ID) for all autism/ABA claims, addressed to "Optum
     Behavioral Health." That QRG is Medicaid-specific, so it's applied
     to the COMMERCIAL unitedhealthcare-north-carolina guide as
     'inferred' cross-state/cross-LOB pattern evidence, not verified —
     pVerify separately lists a distinct "UHG007 United Healthcare -
     Optum Behavioral Solutions" entry not resolved against 87726 for
     commercial NC specifically.

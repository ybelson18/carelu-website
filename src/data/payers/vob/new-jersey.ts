/* ================================================================
   VOB ENRICHMENT — New Jersey, Layers 1 (EDI routing crosswalk) + 3
   (code-level coverage grid) + 4 (Medicaid rate tables, Medicaid lines
   only). See docs/vob-build.md for the spec. Covers NJ FamilyCare FFS,
   its 5 MCOs, and the 3 commercial guides:
   new-jersey-medicaid, horizon-nj-health,
   aetna-better-health-new-jersey, fidelis-care-new-jersey,
   unitedhealthcare-community-plan-new-jersey, wellpoint-new-jersey,
   aetna-new-jersey, cigna-new-jersey, unitedhealthcare-new-jersey.

   Sourcing notes (read before editing):
   - NJ FamilyCare's fiscal agent is Gainwell Technologies; the MMIS is
     NJMMIS. The NJMMIS 5010 270/271 companion guide (Dec 2022) was read
     in full: managed-care enrollment surfaces in Loop 2110C
     (EB04='HM' + REF01='18' → REF02 = 3-digit Managed Care Plan Code,
     REF03 = plan name) and Loop 2120C (NM101='PRP' → NM103 = MCO name,
     PER = MCO phone). The guide does NOT publish the 3-digit-code →
     MCO-name crosswalk (its Appendix 3 lists only eligibility-category
     names, none of the 5 MCOs) — so mcoCarrierCodes ships empty/
     'unverified' with a verifyVia, per the never-guess rule.
   - Layer 3 (codeGrid) restructures facts already verified in the prose
     corpus (src/data/payers/new-jersey.ts): the EPSDT benefit runs
     through the 5 MCOs since 4/1/2020; the MCO authorizes a QHP
     assessment and then the treatment plan; NO prior authorization is
     required while a member is FFS pending MCO enrollment; the state's
     "suggested" daily unit table (97151 32u, 97152 8u, 97153 32u,
     97154 12u, 97155 24u, 97156 16u, 97157 16u, 97158 16u, 0362T 8u,
     0373T 32u) is "guidance only" but the MCOs run it as MUE claim
     edits. That unit table was corroborated by the Aetna Better Health
     NJ 2020 rate sheet (which reproduces it verbatim), since the
     founding DMAHS newsletter PDF now 404s.
   - Layer 4 (rates) is Medicaid-only. NJ publishes real FFS rates.
     97153 $15.00 (raised from $11.20 eff 2/1/2022), 97155 $21.25, and
     97156 $25.00 are confirmed CURRENT (NJMMIS Procedure Master Listing
     CY2026 Q2, via ProviderSpark). The remaining codes' launch-era
     values come from the Aetna 2020 rate sheet and ship with an
     'unverified-as-current' note + a verifyVia to the portal-download
     Procedure Master Listing — the primary CY2026 listing is a portal
     download, not a fetchable URL. Aetna Better Health NJ's own sheet
     still shows the launch-era $11.20 on 97153 (now stale vs. the state
     $15.00) — carried honestly as the plan's published figure.
   - The 5 MCOs are not required to match the FFS schedule. Aetna
     publishes its own (launch-era) sheet; Horizon/Fidelis/UHC/Wellpoint
     publish no ABA fee schedule, so their rate tables reference the FFS
     schedule as the documented baseline with an unverified note.
   - Commercial guides (aetna-new-jersey, cigna-new-jersey,
     unitedhealthcare-new-jersey) get Layers 1+3 only — commercial ABA
     rates are contract-specific and out of scope. cigna-new-jersey,
     unlike cigna-virginia, HAS a real PA panel: EN0499 applies to NJ
     (no carve-out) — no PA on assessment codes 97151/97152/0362T,
     treatment PA required.
   - Carve-out reality check (from EDI research): Wellpoint's Carelon
     Behavioral Health relationship is utilization-management ONLY — BH/
     ABA claims still ride WLPNT via Availity (no separate Carelon claims
     payer ID). UHC Community Plan and UHC commercial use Optum for the
     BH network/authorizations but claims ride the medical payer ID
     (87726). Both are recorded as abaRidesOn='medical', not 'bh'.

/* ==================== Layer 2 — STC interpretation maps ====================
   The NJMMIS 5010 270/271 Companion Guide (NJMMIS_270271_CG, already read in
   full above for Layer 1 / medicaid271Notes) documents managed-care
   enrollment loops/segments in detail but does NOT publish a service-type-
   code (STC) support table — it never states which STCs NJMMIS returns or
   whether ABA-relevant cost-share detail (deductible/copay/coinsurance) is
   populated on the wire. No independent NJ Medicaid 270/271 STC document
   was located this pass. new-jersey-medicaid and its 5 MCOs (Horizon,
   Aetna Better Health, Fidelis, UHC Community Plan, Wellpoint — all NJ
   FamilyCare Medicaid managed-care lines, NOT the commercial book of
   business the national aetna/anthem/uhc family defaults represent) run
   their own PA/eligibility per the EDI sections above but have no
   independently published 270/271 STC table of their own, so they ship
   fully 'unverified' rather than guessed from another state's pattern or
   borrowed from a commercial family default. The separate Layer-0 prose
   file (src/data/payers/new-jersey.ts) documents the EPSDT benefit design
   in detail (MCO authorization workflow, daily unit limits, FFS rates) but
   contains no statement of EPSDT member cost-share ($0 or otherwise) — so
   deductibleAppliesToAba ships 'unverified', not inferred, here too. */

/* ==================== Layer 7 — contact & channel layer ====================
   Contact facts are sourced two ways: (a) mined verbatim from notes on
   source refs already used elsewhere in this file (fax/phone numbers the
   prior sourcing pass already read and quoted); (b) the DMAHS BH Integration
   Points of Contact V3.1 PDF (DMAHS_BH_CONTACTS, already cited in the EDI
   layer), fetched in full for this pass — it carries a per-MCO "ABA Contact"
   / "Provider Services" / fax block that supersedes the older, thinner notes
   (e.g. it shows Horizon has migrated its UM/claims workflow onto Availity,
   not the 2020-era NaviNet tool cited in HORIZON_ABA_OVERVIEW). Commercial
   guides required fresh fetches of each carrier's own national provider-
   services contact page; Aetna's own precertification page states precert
   phone numbers are printed on the member's ID card rather than published
   as one universal number, so aetna-new-jersey ships with NO
   providerServicesPhone — a verified absence, not an oversight.

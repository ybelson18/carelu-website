/* ================================================================
   VOB ENRICHMENT — National commercial guides (aetna, cigna,
   unitedhealthcare-optum), Layers 1 (EDI routing crosswalk) and 3
   (code-level coverage grid) only — no rates, per docs/vob-build.md
   ("Do not attempt commercial rates").

   Sourcing notes (read before editing):
   - These are national-policy guides, not state guides: the clinical
     policies (Aetna CPB 0554/0648, Cigna/Evernorth EN0499, Optum's
     ABA Supplemental Clinical Criteria + Reimbursement Policy
     2022RP501A) are the SAME documents already cited in
     src/data/payers/national.ts and independently re-read during the
     Texas commercial build (vob/texas.ts's aetna-texas, cigna-texas,
     and unitedhealthcare-texas entries) — no new documents were
     fetched this pass; this file restructures already-verified facts
     into the national-scope guide, per the build spec's Layer 1/6
     guidance to reuse family manuals and the Layer 6 carve-out map
     rather than re-deriving.
   - EDI payer IDs are the generic national pVerify/Availity/Change
     Healthcare codes already used (and labeled as generic, not
     state-specific) in vob/texas.ts: Aetna 00001/60054, Cigna
     00004/62308, UnitedHealthcare 00192/87726.
   - BH carve-out fields are pulled directly from vob/carveouts.ts's
     Layer 6 'US' rows: Cigna -> Evernorth Behavioral Health (62308,
     no second EDI hop, confirmed identical in 18 of 19 states'
     guides) ships verified; Aetna's national row is fully
     'unverified' (no BH administrator named in any of the 19 states'
     guides); UnitedHealthcare/Optum has NO 'US' row in carveouts.ts
     by design — payer ID and administered-on side genuinely vary by
     state (87726 in FL/NC vs UHG007 in NY, both unresolved against
     each other) — so the national guide ships administratorPayerId
     'unverified' rather than picking one state's value as a default.
   - codeGrid unitCap/posAllowed ship 'plan-dependent' (not
     'unverified') for most codes: unlike a single state's Medicaid
     benefit, a national commercial guide spans fully-insured and
     self-funded/ERISA plans across every state mandate, and none of
     the three clinical policies state a universal unit/session
     structure — 'plan-dependent' honestly reflects that the reason
     is plan variation, not a research gap. Where a national policy
     DOES state a concrete figure (Aetna's per-code telehealth list;
     Cigna's "all ABA CPT codes are covered telehealth"; Optum's
     cluster/modifier/max-daily-unit figures in Reimbursement Policy
     2022RP501A), that figure ships with its own fieldStatus rather
     than being flattened to 'plan-dependent'.

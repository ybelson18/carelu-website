/* ================================================================
   VOB ENRICHMENT — Florida, Layers 1 (EDI routing crosswalk) + 3
   (code-level coverage grid) + 4 (Medicaid rate table; NONE for
   commercial guides — contract-specific, excluded by spec). See
   docs/vob-build.md for the spec.

   This file merges TWO sibling change-sets, delivered in parallel and
   combined here (rebase conflicts on this file resolve as keep-both,
   per the build brief):

   SPLIT A covers florida-medicaid, sunshine-health-florida,
   cms-health-plan-florida, simply-healthcare-florida,
   unitedhealthcare-community-plan-florida, and
   humana-healthy-horizons-florida. Its sourcing notes (below) apply
   to the shared FL_CODE_FACTS/ahcaStateEntry/mcoEntry infrastructure,
   which SPLIT B (this file's remaining four Medicaid MMA guides)
   reuses as-is rather than duplicating with a separately-sourced
   (and, on cross-check, less authoritative) code grid — see the
   SPLIT B note at the end of this comment block for why.

   SPLIT A sourcing notes (read before editing):
   - The FLMMIS 270/271 Companion Guide (v4.0, 2023-04-27, Gainwell/
     AHCA fiscal agent) WAS retrieved and read in full — unlike
     Georgia's, this one is a fetchable static PDF. It confirms
     Florida's canonical X12 payer ID (77027) and the exact 271 loop/
     segment carrying managed-care enrollment (Loop 2110C "Managed
     Care" repetition + nested Loop 2120C free-text entity name — NOT
     a fixed carrier-code table; that absence is itself the verified
     fact for medicaid271Notes.mcoCarrierCodes).
   - The current (2025 AND 2026 — rates unchanged) AHCA Behavior
     Analysis fee schedule WAS retrieved directly from ahca.myflorida.
     gov as fetchable PDFs (their WAF blocks a default WebFetch
     User-Agent but not a browser-like one). This produces a real,
     citable finding: CPT 97157 does not appear on either fee
     schedule and is not listed among covered service categories in
     the Dec 2024 coverage policy (§4.2.2) — cross-confirmed absent
     from Sunshine Health's own coding table (FL.CP.BH.500) and
     Humana's Florida Medicaid PA list too. Shipped as covered:'No'
     with fieldStatus 'verified' (verified-absent, not a guess) —
     see the FL_CODE_FACTS['97157'] entry below. SPLIT B independently
     reached the same conclusion (97157 absent from the coverage
     policy text and every fee-schedule tracker it could reach) before
     the two splits were combined — genuine cross-validation, not
     copied work.
   - Florida's AHCA BA Coverage Policy (Dec 2024, Rule 59G-4.125)
     binds ALL 9 MMA plans to its service-coverage floor/ceiling
     (§1.2: plans "must not be subject to more stringent service
     coverage limits than specified in Florida Medicaid policies").
     None of the 4 MCOs in split A (Sunshine/CMS Health Plan,
     Simply/Carelon, UHC Community Plan/Optum, Humana) publish a
     full code-level unit-cap/POS/telehealth table of their own —
     each MCO's codeGrid below therefore starts from the AHCA
     statewide facts (fieldStatus 'inferred' by default) and is
     upgraded to 'verified' per-field only where that specific
     plan's own document independently restates or confirms the
     fact (Sunshine's FL.CP.BH.500 clinical policy is by far the
     most detailed of the four and confirms the most fields). SPLIT
     B's four MMA guides (Aetna Better Health, Molina, Community Care
     Plan, Florida Community Care) follow the identical pattern via
     the same mcoEntry() factory.
   - Telehealth is a genuine, verified quirk in Florida: ONLY 97156
     (family/caregiver training) has a stated telehealth allowance
     anywhere in state or plan documentation — GT modifier, capped at
     2 hrs/week, per Rule 59G-1.057, F.A.C. Every other code is
     telehealth:'No' by design, not by omission — this is the
     opposite pattern from Georgia (which allows telehealth broadly
     via POS 02/10 on every code).
   - No Florida BA document — state or plan-level — publishes numeric
     CMS place-of-service codes (no "POS 11/12/02/10" table like
     Georgia's). Every posAllowed value here is a categorical setting
     (home/office/school/community) drawn from plan PA-form checkboxes
     or the coverage policy's IEP/504 school-based requirement; that
     absence of numeric POS codes is itself a verified finding, not a
     gap left for later.
   - Sunshine Health's reported BA network-enrollment pause — flagged
     'unconfirmed' in the shipped florida.ts prose (citing only a
     3piesquared.com industry blog) — IS NOW CONFIRMED from Sunshine's
     own newsroom: a pause on adding new practitioners to existing BA
     groups took effect 2025-10-01 (all AHCA regions except A and B),
     and a partial reversal lifted it in Regions E and F starting
     2026-03-01. Carried into codeGrid notes for the 97153 entry on
     both sunshine-health-florida and cms-health-plan-florida per the
     build brief's instruction to note it there when verifiable.
   - Simply Healthcare's BA benefit is delegated to Carelon Behavioral
     Health for BOTH authorizations and claims (confirmed, not just
     auths) — abaRidesOn:'bh' with twoHopRequired:true, distinct from
     UHC Community Plan/Optum, where Optum manages utilization review
     but claims still bill under UHC's own payer ID 87726 (same ID as
     medical) — abaRidesOn:'medical', twoHopRequired:false. No
     Florida-specific Carelon EDI payer ID could be confirmed (only a
     national pVerify listing, 002465); a commonly-cited "BHOVO" code
     could not be verified against any primary Carelon source.
   - Sunshine's own site states its payer ID is 68069, but Availity's
     payer list separately shows "FLORIDA SUNSHINE STATE HEALTH PLAN"
     = 68057 and a distinct "Centene Corporation" = 68069 — an
     unresolved conflict between two source-adjacent listings, shipped
     as 'inferred' with the conflict spelled out in verifyVia rather
     than silently picking one.
   - UnitedHealthcare Community Plan of Florida's own BA quick-
     reference guides (FL-BAP-QRG.pdf and Optum's FLABAQRG.pdf) were
     both fetched and read in full and contain ZERO code-level detail
     (no CPT table, no unit caps, no POS, no telehealth, no modifiers)
     — confirmed to be 3-page administrative documents only. Optum's
     NATIONAL commercial ABA Reimbursement Policy (2022RP501A, used
     for Georgia's UHC entry) explicitly should NOT be extended to FL
     Medicaid: it uses a four-tier HN/HM/HO/HP modifier system, but
     the AHCA fee schedule that governs FL Medicaid (including UHC
     Community Plan, per the coverage policy's plan-compliance clause)
     uses only HN plus group-size U-modifiers — a materially different
     scheme. This guide's codeGrid therefore inherits AHCA's numbers,
     not Optum's national policy. SPLIT B's UnitedHealthcare FLORIDA
     COMMERCIAL guide (a different line of business) correctly keeps
     Optum's national 2022RP501A HN/HM/HO/HP scheme, since that guide
     is NOT bound by the AHCA Medicaid fee schedule.
   - Humana's own materials explicitly defer coding mechanics to AHCA
     in writing ("Procedure codes and the latest published fee
     schedules can be found on the AHCA website... Rule 59G-4.002") —
     the cleanest, most explicit deferral statement found in this
     split, cited verbatim in the Humana codeGrid entries. Humana's PA
     form (MCD 466, now reissued as 1023905FL0616) also gives a concrete, previously-unpublished
     number: non-par providers are reimbursed at 80% of the Florida
     Medicaid fee schedule absent a controlling legal requirement or
     Letter of Agreement — replacing the vague "a percentage of..."
     language in the shipped florida.ts prose with an exact figure.
   - "TNFL" (Therapy Network of Florida / Health System One) was
     investigated per the build brief and confirmed to administer BA
     for Community Care Plan — a Florida MMA plan OUTSIDE split A's
     6 guides, covered by split B (below) instead, with its own
     independently-read TNFL Behavior Analysis Provider Manual.

   SPLIT B sourcing notes (read before editing) — covers
   aetna-better-health-florida, molina-healthcare-florida,
   community-care-plan-florida, florida-community-care, and the
   Aetna/Cigna/UnitedHealthcare Florida COMMERCIAL guides:
   - Split B's own first-pass code grid was built from a
     PDF-text-extraction read of the AHCA coverage policy plus a
     secondary fee-schedule tracker (AHCA's own fee-schedule PDF 403s
     a default WebFetch User-Agent). Split A independently retrieved
     the ACTUAL AHCA fee-schedule PDFs (browser-spoofed request) and
     three MCOs' own coding documents (Sunshine's FL.CP.BH.500,
     Humana's PA form/PAL, Simply's Carelon training deck) — a
     materially stronger primary-source base for the exact same
     statewide facts. Per "accuracy beats completeness," split B's
     four MMA guides below were rebuilt on split A's
     FL_CODE_FACTS/mcoEntry() infrastructure rather than keeping a
     parallel, weaker-sourced code grid — the discarded first-pass
     version is not preserved here; its sourcing gaps are superseded,
     not merely duplicated.
   - Aetna Better Health of Florida's own Quick Reference Guide (Rev.
     11/2024, read directly) confirms EDI/EFT payer ID 128FL and Real
     Time payer ID ABHFL via its Office Ally enrollment section, plus
     a Behavioral Health-specific PA phone line (1-833-365-2474)
     distinct from the Physical Health line — not previously
     documented in florida.ts.
   - Florida Community Care's own BA services page (read directly)
     names Behavioral Services Network (BSN) as its behavioral-health
     network partner — a fact absent from florida.ts's existing FCC
     prose, which describes FCC BA authorization as fully in-house.
     Both are true at once: BSN appears to handle network
     credentialing/contracting (as it does for Aetna Better Health of
     Florida), while FCC's own Utilization Department still adjudicates
     the actual BA prior-authorization requests by fax/email/portal.
   - Community Care Plan's BA is fully delegated to Therapy Network of
     Florida (TNFL) for BOTH authorizations and claims — TNFL's own
     Behavior Analysis Provider Manual (read in full) states verbatim
     "Our Payer ID is 65062 for professional claims and 12k89 for
     institutional claims," and restates the 40-hrs/week threshold and
     6-participant group cap directly (upgraded to 'verified' via
     mcoEntry()'s confirmed-fields mechanism, same pattern split A
     uses for Sunshine/Humana).
   - UnitedHealthcare/Optum's national COMMERCIAL claims-routing payer
     ID (87726) is confirmed directly from Optum's own Provider
     Express EDI page ("The Optum payer ID is 87726"), matching the
     identical finding already shipped for UnitedHealthcare Community
     Plan of North Carolina (vob/north-carolina.ts) — an upgrade over
     Georgia's 'unverified' Availity ID and 'unverified' BH
     administratorPayerId/abaRidesOn for the same carrier family.
     Cigna/Evernorth's same-payer-ID pass-through (62308, no second
     EDI hop) is confirmed via the same national Autism Resource Guide
     already cited in Georgia. Aetna's commercial BH administration
     remains unverified: its own June 2022 OfficeLink Updates page was
     checked directly and says nothing about in-house vs. carve-out
     claims administration — an absence of evidence, not confirmation.
   - The Availity payer list PDF used by both splits (same URL) turns
     out to carry an "As of 08/08/2012" footer on every page — split
     A flags this correctly (AVAILITY_PAYER_LIST_STALE); split B's
     Aetna-florida commercial entry has been corrected accordingly
     (payerId.availity/changeHealthcare downgraded from 'verified' to
     'inferred', since 60054 is a long-standing national ID rather
     than independently reconfirmed this pass) — a real correction
     made during the merge, not a silent copy of the pre-merge value.

     to match the prose exactly (Sunshine's PA fax, Humana's IVR/fax, FCC's
     call center/PA fax, ABHFL's BH PA line, TNFL's payer ID) because both

     returned HTTP 503 to every WebFetch attempt this pass (homepage,

     is what's shipped for florida-medicaid; the Acentra eQSuite URL is

     WebFetch/WebSearch-then-WebFetch rather than reused from any existing

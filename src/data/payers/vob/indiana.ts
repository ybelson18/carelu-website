/* ================================================================
   VOB ENRICHMENT — Indiana, Layers 1 (EDI routing crosswalk) + 3
   (code-level coverage grid) + 4 (Medicaid rate tables). See
   docs/vob-build.md for the spec. Scope for this state: Medicaid
   lines only for Layer 4 (indiana-medicaid + its four active MCEs +
   the historical MDwise entry) — commercial guides (aetna-indiana,
   cigna-indiana, unitedhealthcare-indiana) ship Layers 1+3 only, per
   the build spec's "do not attempt commercial rates" rule.

   Sourcing notes (read before editing):
   - The 270/271 IHCP Companion Guide (Version 4.2, Publication Date
     March 31, 2026, in.gov/medicaid/providers/files/270-271-ihcp-
     companion-guide.pdf) was successfully retrieved and parsed this
     pass — unlike Georgia's equivalent, this document IS machine-
     readable. Section 7.4.5 "MANAGED CARE" gives the exact loop/
     segment for MCE enrollment (Loop 2100C EB/NM1) and confirms both
     batch and interactive (real-time) 270/271 are supported via CAQH
     CORE compliant web services. It does NOT publish a numeric
     carrier-code-to-MCE crosswalk table — MCEs are identified by a
     free-text program name (EB05) plus an MCE-assigned entity
     identifier (NM109), not a fixed code list — so
     medicaid271Notes.mcoCarrierCodes ships empty/unverified by design,
     not from a lookup failure.
   - IHCP Bulletin BT202627 (Feb 26, 2026) was also successfully
     retrieved and parsed — it carries the FULL individual and group
     ABA rate tables (Tables 1-3) for the current (DOS ≥4/1/2026) and
     upcoming (DOS ≥4/1/2027) phasedown steps. This is the strongest
     Layer 4 sourcing of any state shipped so far: every code, every
     modifier tier, both rate steps, directly from the bulletin PDF
     text (not a secondary summary).
   - The IHCP "Behavioral Health Services Codes" provider code table
     (provider.indianamedicaid.com, published April 2, 2026) supplied
     the exact per-code modifier requirements (practitioner-credential
     tier U1/U2/U3, group-size tier U4/U6/U8, comprehensive-therapy
     modifier UA) used in every indiana-medicaid codeGrid entry below.
   - No per-code POS list or per-code daily/weekly unit cap is
     published in either source — IHCP's model caps ABA at the
     PA-request level (≤40 hrs/week; comprehensive ABA draws from a
     4,000-hour lifetime allocation) rather than a per-code daily
     max the way Georgia's DCH does. posAllowed ships 'unverified'
     throughout; unitCap/capPeriod describe the PA-level structure.
   - MCE guides (Anthem, MHS, CareSource, UnitedHealthcare Community
     Plan) each publish PA-process detail (forms, documentation
     packages) but NOT their own code-level unit-cap/modifier tables —
     their codeGrid entries are 'inferred' from the statewide IHCP
     pattern above, same treatment Georgia gave Amerigroup/Peach State.
   - MDwise ended as an Indiana Medicaid MCE effective January 1, 2026
     (FSSA press release, in.gov/fssa/files/MDwise-Participation_
     FINAL-2025.pdf). Its vob entry ships for historical/reference
     completeness only — every field carries an EXITED notice, and the
     entry should NOT be used to route a live 2026+ eligibility check.
     Members were reassigned to Anthem, CareSource, or MHS.
   - pVerify's public payer list flags "00709 ANTHEM BCBS INDIANA" as
     Eligibility=No / Claim=No in its own table — surfaced verbatim in
     verifyVia rather than silently treated as a working ID. The
     Availity Essentials payer list carries the same "As of 08/08/2012"
     staleness footer already flagged in georgia.ts/aetna-florida —
     every Availity ID below is downgraded to 'inferred' for the same
     reason. National commercial payer IDs (Aetna 00001/60054, Cigna
     00004/62308, UnitedHealthcare 00192/87726) are reused verbatim
     from georgia.ts: these are the SAME national pVerify/Availity
     entries (re-confirmed by direct re-fetch this pass, access date
     below), not a guess carried over from another state.

/* ==================== Layer 2 — STC interpretation maps ====================
   The IHCP 270/271 Companion Guide (IHCP_COMPANION_GUIDE above) was, unlike
   Georgia's GAMMIS equivalent, successfully retrieved and parsed in full this
   pass — but the sections read (§4.1/§4.3 transaction support, §7.4.5 Managed
   Care loop/segment) do not include a service-type-code (STC) support table
   analogous to Cigna's §7.1.1 or UHC's §6.2 (see stc-defaults.ts). No such
   table was located anywhere in IHCP's public EDI documentation this pass,
   and none of the five MCE guides (Anthem, MHS, CareSource, MDwise, UHC
   Community Plan) publishes its own 270/271 STC table independent of IHCP's
   feed. Per the "never guess" rule, indiana-medicaid and all five MCEs ship
   fully 'unverified' rather than inferred from a national commercial family
   pattern — Medicaid managed care is a distinct book of business from the
   commercial families in stc-defaults.ts and must not borrow their values
   (per this task's classification: anthem-indiana-medicaid and
   unitedhealthcare-community-plan-indiana are Medicaid lines, not the
   commercial anthemFamilyStc/uhcFamilyStc). indiana.ts's own Layer-0 prose
   file (src/data/payers/indiana.ts) documents the 2026 EPSDT-only shift but
   does not state a $0 EPSDT cost-share figure with a citation, so
   deductibleAppliesToAba is left 'unverified' rather than inferred from the
   general federal EPSDT cost-sharing bar. */

   VOB ENRICHMENT — Virginia, Layers 1 (EDI routing crosswalk) + 3
   (code-level coverage grid) + 4 (Medicaid rate tables, Medicaid lines
   only). See docs/vob-build.md for the spec. Covers the state Medicaid
   FFS guide, its 5 Cardinal Care MCOs, and the 3 commercial guides:
   virginia-medicaid, aetna-better-health-virginia,
   anthem-healthkeepers-plus, humana-healthy-horizons-virginia,
   sentara-community-plan, unitedhealthcare-community-plan-virginia,
   aetna-virginia, cigna-virginia, unitedhealthcare-virginia.

   Sourcing notes (read before editing):
   - Virginia Medicaid's fiscal agent moved to Acentra Health under the
     Medicaid Enterprise System (MES). The MES/DMAS 270/271 companion
     guide governs where a member's Cardinal Care MCO enrollment appears
     in the 271; see virginia-medicaid.edi.medicaid271Notes for the
     retrieval outcome (populated where confirmed, 'unverified' with a
     verifyVia where the document could not be retrieved this pass — per
     the never-guess rule, NOT a placeholder filled from pattern).
   - Layer 3 (codeGrid) is almost entirely a restructuring of facts
     already verified in the prose corpus (src/data/payers/virginia.ts):
     the DMAS rule that assessment codes 97151/97152/0362T need NO
     service authorization, that all treatment hours require SA with
     units itemized per CPT code effective 10/15/2025, the ≥20-hrs/week
     (80-unit) activity-schedule threshold, and the licensure-tier
     modifiers (no modifier = technician, HN = LABA, TF = LMHP,
     HO = LBA). Two MCO-specific facts change the grid: Anthem
     HealthKeepers Plus publishes the state's clearest code/modifier/POS
     grid (GT telehealth on all eight 97xxx codes 97151-97158; school POS 03 on
     97151/97155/97156), and Humana's PA list flags 0362T as
     PA-required — a genuine deviation from the DMAS assessment-code
     baseline, carried honestly rather than normalized away.
   - Layer 4 (rates) is Medicaid-only per the build scope. The DMAS
     licensure-tiered per-15-minute rates come from the DMAS procedure
     fee file (CPT) and the VirginiaABA billing guidance already cited
     in the prose. Codes/tiers the fee file states are shipped
     'verified'; codes the prose did not enumerate ship 'unverified'
     with a verifyVia to the DMAS fee file. The 5 Cardinal Care MCOs run
     the identical DMAS criteria and forms; they are not required to
     match the FFS fee schedule, so their rate tables reference the DMAS
     schedule as the documented baseline, not a plan-confirmed paid rate.
   - Commercial guides (aetna-virginia, cigna-virginia,
     unitedhealthcare-virginia) get Layers 1+3 only — commercial ABA
     rates are contract-specific and out of scope (no rates block).
   - cigna-virginia intentionally has NO PA panel: the current EN0499
     policy explicitly does not apply to Virginia fully-insured
     business, so its codeGrid reflects that exclusion honestly rather
     than inventing PA verdicts. See its codeGrid notes.

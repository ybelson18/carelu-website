/* ================================================================
   Layer 6 — carve-out map: carrier family x state x line of business
   -> BH administrator + payer ID + which side administers ABA, so
   hop-2 eligibility routing never needs a human. Populated from
   provider manuals already cited in src/data/payers/<state>.ts and
   src/data/payers/vob/<state>.ts (see docs/vob-build.md); served at
   /api/payers/carveouts.

   Sourcing notes (read before editing):
   - Every row traces to a fact already cited (with primary-source
     URL) somewhere in this corpus — either a state guide's prose or
     an already-shipped vob/<state>.ts edi.bhCarveOut object. This
     file does not introduce any new primary-source research; it
     restructures what the corpus already verified into the flat
     carrier x state x LOB shape Layer 6 asks for.
   - 'US' rows are used ONLY where the same administrator/payerId/
     abaAdministeredOn combination was independently confirmed,
     in the guide prose, across a large majority of the 19 states
     (Cigna/Evernorth). Every other family's behavior differs by
     state (or by Medicaid plan) and is NOT collapsed to a US row,
     per the build spec.
   - administrator/administratorPayerId/abaAdministeredOn are the
     literal string 'unverified' wherever no primary source in the
     corpus states the value — never guessed. Where a value is
     stated but only inferred from a cross-LOB or cross-guide
     pattern (not a document naming it directly for this exact row),
     that caveat is in the row's notes.
   - KNOWN CROSS-FILE INCONSISTENCY (flagged, not silently resolved):
     Optum Behavioral Health's payer ID appears as 87726 in the
     Florida and North Carolina vob files but as UHG007 in the New
     York vob file, for what both describe as the same UHC-Optum
     commercial arrangement. Neither vob file resolves this — see
     the unitedhealthcare/FL,NC vs unitedhealthcare/NY rows below.
     QA should reconcile; this file reproduces both values as found
     rather than picking one.

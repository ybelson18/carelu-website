/* ================================================================
   VOB ENRICHMENT — Tennessee, Layers 1 (EDI routing crosswalk) + 3
   (code-level coverage grid) + 4 (Medicaid rate tables, Medicaid
   guides only). See docs/vob-build.md for the spec.

   Sourcing notes (read before editing):
   - TennCare is 100% MCO-administered ABA — no direct state FFS ABA
     program. The shared "ABA Provider Requirements and Program
     Description" (rev. 06/13/2024, TNWP-CD-061917-24) and the
     "Universal Request for ABA" form (TN-WP-CD-000947-25-S506-A,
     Jan 2026) are the coding-mechanics sources for all three MCOs'
     shared baseline — already cited in src/data/payers/tennessee.ts.
     Both were fetched and read in full this pass (unlike GA's
     inaccessible companion guide): the Program Description's own
     "ABA Codes" appendix and the Universal Request form's CPT table
     cover ONLY 97151-97158 — 0362T and 0373T appear in NEITHER
     document, so they're marked "not confirmed in the shared code
     set" for wellpoint-tennessee and
     unitedhealthcare-community-plan-tennessee. BlueCare Tennessee is
     the one confirmed exception: its own 563-page Provider
     Administration Manual (H3259_W14_P2_07012026 v2) carries full CPT
     descriptions for 0362T AND 0373T in its own ABA code table — a
     genuine, sourced per-MCO difference, not collapsed into one
     shared value. tenncare-tennessee-medicaid (the umbrella guide)
     reflects this as "mixed by MCO," not a single yes/no.
   - TennCare's state-level EDI is documented in its own public "EDI
     Front Matter" (V8.0, February 2026) — unlike GA's companion
     guide, this document WAS retrievable in full and confirms 270/271
     eligibility (X12 V5010X279A1) is handled directly by TennCare —
     NOT brokered through its Managed Care Contractors (MCCs), which
     instead process 276/277, 278, 820, 834, 835, and 837I/D/P — via
     real-time SOAP (~0.5s avg response, $10,000 setup + $0.04/req) or
     batch SFTP (up to 100,000 members/file, $2,500 setup +
     $0.02/req). It does NOT name a loop/segment for MCO enrollment or
     a carrier-code crosswalk — the actual TennCare Companion Guide
     (TCCG) covering that detail is, per the Front Matter itself,
     "available to registered Trading Partners upon request," not a
     public download. medicaid271Notes is therefore unverified for the
     same reason GA's was (a real, confirmed gap, not a placeholder to
     fill), but with a much more specific verifyVia (request the TCCG
     from EDI.TennCare@tn.gov) than GA's "portal returns 403."
   - Because the state's own EDI Front Matter positions 270/271 as a
     state-run transaction (not an MCC/MCO one), none of the three
     MCOs has a confirmed MCO-specific 270/271 trading-partner
     relationship of its own for TennCare eligibility in any source
     found this pass — each MCO's supports270271/supportsRealtime is
     marked unverified for exactly this reason, with a verifyVia
     pointing back to the state-level pVerify entry ("00185 Tennessee
     Medicaid (TennCare)," Elig=Yes) as the practical fallback for
     confirming TennCare enrollment before routing to a specific MCO.
     UnitedHealthcare Community Plan of Tennessee is the one
     exception: pVerify's own list separately carries a dedicated
     "UHG003 United Healthcare Community Plan Tennessee" line flagged
     Elig=Yes, so supports270271 is verified true for that guide only.
   - TennCare publishes no ABA fee schedule at all — confirmed in
     tennessee.ts's own "Rates: negotiated, not published" section and
     re-confirmed here via the same CSG South comparison document
     (every TN cell blank). All four Medicaid guides ship an explicit
     RateTable with every byCode entry set to the literal 'unverified'
     and a source explaining why, pointing to the member's specific
     MCO provider contract as the only source of truth. This is the
     correct, confirmed outcome per the build spec — not a gap to be
     filled with a number.
   - Commercial Aetna/Cigna/UnitedHealthcare sections reuse the exact
     national source set and codeGrid factory pattern georgia.ts
     already established (AETNA_CPB0554/0648, CIGNA_EN0499, OPTUM_SCC,
     OPTUM_REIMBURSEMENT_POLICY) — these are national policies with no
     TN-specific coding mechanics published, so the "unverified, not
     invented" fields carry over unchanged. Note: tennessee.ts's own
     prose cites an Aetna precert form "GR-69017-4" and an Optum
     "two-step, every 4-6 months / 80% utilization" cadence for UHC —
     georgia.ts's own QA re-check (2026-07-23) found neither fact
     actually stated in the cited CPBs/Optum documents and removed
     them from its codeGrid. This file follows georgia.ts's finding
     (not tennessee.ts's older, unverified-against-source prose) for
     the same reason: the underlying primary source doesn't say it.
   - pVerify's public payer list (3/2026, 54 pages) and Availity's
     public 837 payer list (57 pages) were both fetched and searched
     directly this pass (not just copied from georgia.ts's cached
     findings). The Availity list still carries the same "As of
     08/08/2012" footer QA'd in georgia.ts/aetna-florida; any row
     pulled from it is fieldStatus 'inferred', not 'verified', per that
     same precedent. No BlueCare-, Wellpoint-, or TennCare-Medicaid-
     specific row was found anywhere in that document — only the
     national Aetna/Cigna/UnitedHealthcare commercial rows.
   - Wellpoint Tennessee's own provider EDI page (fetched directly)
     states its Availity payer ID is WLPNT — a live, TN-specific,
     low-staleness primary source, unlike the 2012 Availity snapshot.
     UnitedHealthcare's own multistate "Claims Payer List for
     UnitedHealthcare, Affiliates and Strategic Alliances" (dated
     5/13/2026, same document already cited in carveouts.ts's NY row)
     gives UnitedHealthcare Community Plan of TN its own Medical Payer
     ID (95378) distinct from the multi-state 87726 grouping used for
     most other states — but the stale 2012 Availity snapshot maps
     that same number (95378) to a DIFFERENT UHC affiliate ("UNITED
     HEALTHCARE OF RIVER VALLEY"), a genuine cross-source conflict
     flagged here rather than silently resolved (same treatment as the
     87726/UHG007 conflict already flagged in carveouts.ts for NY).
   - bhCarveOut fields throughout are kept consistent with the rows
     already shipped in vob/carveouts.ts (Cigna/Evernorth 62308 no
     second hop; Aetna commercial fully unverified; UHC commercial TN
     unverified; UHC Medicaid TN's weak "Optum platform" label
     unverified; Wellpoint TN Medicaid "no BH vendor named"). BlueCare
     Tennessee has no row in carveouts.ts at all — a real gap. This
     file's own read of BlueCare's 563-page Provider Administration
     Manual found "Applied Behavior Analyst Services" listed as one of
     many Behavioral Health PA categories BlueCare handles directly,
     submitted via BlueCare's own forms — no external BH vendor
     (Carelon/Optum/Magellan) named anywhere in its Behavioral Health
     sections — so administrator is set to 'none — in-house' with
     fieldStatus 'inferred' (absence-based, same pattern already used
     for the healthy-blue-north-carolina carveout row), not upgraded to
     a fully 'verified' none.

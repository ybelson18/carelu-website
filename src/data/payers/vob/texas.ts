/* ================================================================
   VOB ENRICHMENT — Texas, Layers 1 (EDI routing crosswalk), 3
   (code-level coverage grid), and 4 (Medicaid rate tables). See
   docs/vob-build.md for the spec.

   Sourcing notes (read before editing):
   - docs/vob-gaps.md flagged hhs.texas.gov as 403-blocked to automated
     fetch. tmhp.com is NOT similarly blocked: the 270/271 Medicaid/CHIP
     Eligibility Companion Guide (dated November 2024), the TMPPM
     Children's Services Handbook (§2.3 Autism Services), and TMHP's
     static/PDF fee schedules were all retrieved directly this pass.
     Where a fact below is 'unverified', it's because the specific
     document doesn't state it — not because the document was
     unreachable.
   - The 270/271 Companion Guide's Appendix 11.1 "Managed Care Program
     Codes" table maps STAR/STAR PLUS/STAR Kids/Foster Care/CHIP
     PROGRAM codes into EB05 — it is NOT a per-MCO health-plan lookup
     table. The actual MCO name is carried as free text in REF02
     (REF01=18, "Managed Care Plan Code") inside the 2110C "Covered
     Managed Care" EB loop; the guide's own example shows this as a
     literal placeholder ("MCOPLANNAME"), confirming the mechanism but
     not a fixed code table. medicaid271Notes.mcoCarrierCodes below
     ships the verified PROGRAM code table with that distinction noted
     explicitly, rather than being misrepresented as an MCO lookup.
   - Independently cross-checked against two primary sources — the
     TMPPM Children's Services Handbook §2.3 and TMHP's own "AUTISM
     SERVICES" static fee schedule (PRCR615C) — Texas's actual
     THSteps-CCP Autism Services billable code set is 97151, 97153,
     97154, 97155, 97156, 97158, and 99366. CPT codes 97152, 97157,
     0362T, and 0373T appear in NEITHER document: zero occurrences in
     the full handbook text, zero rows in the fee schedule. Per the
     "capture the state's actual billable code set, don't force the
     CPT list" instruction, those four codes ship 'unverified' in every
     Medicaid-track codeGrid rather than populated with GA/national
     figures that would misrepresent Texas policy.
   - Layer 3's TMPPM-baseline facts (unit caps, modifiers, telehealth
     rules, POS settings) are IDENTICAL across texas-medicaid and all 8
     MCO guides — every MCO guide in the existing texas.ts prose
     already states it applies TMPPM criteria with no distinct ABA
     policy of its own (Superior, TCHP, Wellpoint, Molina, Community
     First, and Driscoll each say so explicitly; Aetna Better Health
     and UHC Community Plan say so by absence of a found override).
     One shared, heavily-sourced grid factory is used for all 9 rather
     than repeating unverifiable "plan-specific" claims per guide.
   - Layer 4 rates: texas-medicaid's rates are the state fee schedule
     itself (verified, PRCR615C). MCO reimbursement is contract-specific
     and not publicly posted for any of the 8 Texas MCOs (already
     established in each guide's existing prose) — MCO rates.byCode
     ships the literal 'unverified' per code with the state schedule
     noted as the benchmark, per "MCO rates: only where publicly
     posted... otherwise unverified."
   - The 3 commercial guides (aetna-texas, cigna-texas,
     unitedhealthcare-texas) get Layers 1 + 3 only, per the build spec
     ("Do not attempt commercial rates"). Their codeGrid uses the full
     national CPT set (97151-97158, 0362T, 0373T) since national
     commercial clinical policy — not the Medicaid benefit's narrower
     code list — governs; texas.ts's own prose already establishes none
     of the three carriers publish a Texas-specific override of their
     national ABA policy (EN0499 for Cigna, CPB 0554/0648 for Aetna,
     Optum's SCC/2022RP501A for UnitedHealthcare, with Optum's ABA State
     Mandates supplement confirmed to have no Texas entry).
   - BH carve-out: Texas's THSteps-CCP Autism Services benefit is NOT
     carved out to a third-party BH administrator anywhere in the state
     (already verified via a TMHP policy release cited in texas.ts) —
     every Medicaid guide below ships bhCarveOut.administrator: 'none'.
     The one nuance is UnitedHealthcare Community Plan of Texas, where
     the existing texas.ts prose (independently verified, cited to UHC's
     own STAR Kids PA list) establishes that ABA authorization is routed
     to UHC's OWN Optum Behavioral Health network rather than its medical
     PA pipeline — a UM-routing carve-out within the UHC/Optum corporate
     family, not a third-party BHO. That guide ships abaRidesOn: 'bh'
     accordingly; every other Medicaid MCO ships abaRidesOn: 'medical'.

/* ==================== Layer 7 — vobContact ====================
   Sourcing notes:
   - Every providerServicesPhone/fax/ivrPath value below was read directly
     off a provider-services/contact-us page or provider quick-reference
     guide fetched this pass (not carried over from memory or from a
     WebSearch snippet alone) — several of these plans' provider manuals
     block automated retrieval (Aetna Better Health TX, Molina TX, per the
     prose already in texas.ts), but their standalone contact-us pages
     were independently fetchable even when the manual PDF was not.
   - Aetna's Texas commercial line (aetna-texas) has no ABA- or
     Texas-specific provider phone published; the number shipped is
     Aetna's national non-Medicare Healthcare Provider Service Center,
     confirmed on Aetna's own contact page. Aetna's Behavioral Health
     Precertification list PDF and ABA precert form PDF were fetched but
     returned no readable phone/fax text — not used as a source for that
     reason (no fabricated digits).
   - portal entries marked "reused" below cite an already-known/well-known
     portal URL for that payer family without a fresh fetch confirming
     that exact URL this pass, per the build spec's lower bar for portal
     accuracy (a wrong URL just 404s, unlike a wrong phone number).
   - Driscoll's fax (1-866-741-5650) reuses the number already verified
     and cited in this guide's own prose/source list (texas.ts,
     driscoll-health-plan treatmentPA field) rather than a fresh fetch
     finding it restated verbatim; a fresh fetch of driscollhealthplan.com
     this pass surfaced a companion PA/referrals phone (1-877-455-1053) at
     the same number's neighborhood, shipped as providerServicesPhone.
   - Closing-sweep addendum (2026-07-23): vobContact for the 6 gap-fill
     TX MCO guides (community-health-choice-texas, bcbs-texas-medicaid,
     cook-childrens-health-plan, parkland-community-health-plan,
     el-paso-health, firstcare-health-plans) below. Fax numbers for
     several of these plans were already fetched and cited in this
     file's own codeGrid notes (see chcEdi/bcbstxMedicaidEdi/cchpEdi/
     pchpEdi/ephEdi/firstcareEdi source blocks above); providerServicesPhone
     numbers were independently confirmed this pass directly from each
     plan's own contact/phone-directory page. FirstCare's Medicaid
     wind-down (confirmed exit 8/31/2026, same as baylor-scott-white-texas)
     applies here too — its contact info is shipped as current through
     that date, not a stable long-term line.

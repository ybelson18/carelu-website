   VOB ENRICHMENT — Massachusetts, Layers 1 (EDI routing crosswalk)
   + 3 (code-level coverage grid) + 4 (Medicaid rate table). See
   docs/vob-build.md for the spec.

   Sourcing notes (read before editing):
   - The MassHealth Standard Companion Guide for 270/271 (ASC X12N
     005010X279A1, cover-dated "November 2023" — 32 months old at
     access date, staleRisk: true) WAS retrieved and read in full.
     It confirms managed-care enrollment rides Loop 2110C: EB01 = L
     (PCC managed care) / MC (MCO, ACO, ICO, CP, SCO, or PACE) / D
     (Community Partner), EB03 = 30, EB05 returns the PLAN NAME AS
     FREE TEXT (verbatim: "MassHealth will generate additional 2110C
     loops to display all applicable benefit plans"). There is NO
     numeric carrier-code-to-plan-name table anywhere in this guide —
     that absence is itself the verified fact for
     medicaid271Notes.mcoCarrierCodes, not a gap to fill. MassHealth's
     own X12 identifier is an ETIN (DMA7384 at 2100A NM108/109,
     qualifier 46) — a different namespace from the clearinghouse
     payer IDs below; do not conflate the two.
   - 101 CMR 358.03(3), the official fee schedule (Mass. Register,
     published 9/27/2024, effective 10/1/2024), was retrieved and its
     table extracted in full. It contains EXACTLY 7 priced rows:
     97151, 97153, 97154, 97155, 97156, 97157, and H0031-U2.
     97152, 97158, 0362T, and 0373T do NOT appear anywhere in the
     published schedule — CONFIRMED ABSENT, not a retrieval failure.
     358.03(4)(b) provides for "individual consideration" pricing of
     unlisted/new codes; no administrative bulletin listing an
     applied rate for these four codes could be located this pass.
     Also confirmed: no unit caps, POS codes, telehealth mechanics, or
     billing modifiers appear anywhere in 101 CMR 358.00-358.05 — it
     is pure rate-setting text, closing out (not leaving open) that
     question.
   - The Carelon/MBHP ABA Performance Specification (updated
     2/15/2026, current) was retrieved in full. It is a clinical/
     administrative spec, not a billing manual: it contains NO CPT-
     level unit caps, POS codes, or telehealth billing modifiers
     (GT/95, POS 02/10) anywhere. It DOES confirm a real, usable
     group-session limit (up to 4.5 hrs/day, groups of 2-8 members)
     and the 1:10 LABA-to-technician supervision floor already in the
     main guide prose. Telehealth is confirmed allowed as a modality
     (parent/caregiver consent, must not replace in-person
     availability) with no modifier or POS code specified in the
     document itself.
   - pVerify's payer-list page (pverify.com/payer-list/, no version/
     date stamp visible) and the Availity Essentials payer list
     (same "As of 08/08/2012" stale PDF already cited in
     vob/georgia.ts and vob/florida.ts) were both queried. Multiple
     MassHealth-family candidates surfaced on pVerify (00133, 01398,
     BO00082, 01421) without a clear single canonical ID — shipped as
     'inferred' with the ambiguity flagged, not resolved by guessing.
     WellSense's current name, Tufts/Point32Health, and
     UnitedHealthcare were queried on pVerify but not found in
     retrieved page content this pass — flagged as likely truncation
     (the live page is very large), not confirmed absence.
   - WellSense's own "EDI Claims Companion Guide for 5010" (v7, March
     2024, ~28 months old, staleRisk: true) confirms payer ID 13337
     for professional claims (cross-validated against the 2012
     Availity snapshot's identical BMC HealthNet Plan number) but
     still names "Beacon Health Strategies" as the BH claims routing
     — per the main guide's already-verified facts, WellSense
     insourced BH administration 1/1/2026, so this document is now
     OUT OF DATE on the carve-out-administrator question specifically
     (the 13337 medical/professional payer ID is presumably
     unaffected). Flagged explicitly in wellsenseEdi below rather than
     silently treated as current.
   - Tufts/Point32Health's 270-271 companion guide ("May 2017", 9+
     years stale) documents a direct SOAP/CORE connection (ReceiverID
     170558746, CORERuleVersion 2.2.0) — a CAQH CORE identifier, NOT
     the same namespace as the 04298 clearinghouse payer ID found via
     Availity. Both are recorded distinctly, not conflated.
   - Mass General Brigham Health Plan's own claims page (first-party,
     current) states behavioral health claims route to Optum, payer
     ID 87726 — the SAME number as UnitedHealthcare's national medical
     payer ID per UHC's own 5/13/2026 payer list. How a clearinghouse
     distinguishes medical vs. BH claims when the ID is shared was
     not confirmed this pass — flagged via verifyVia rather than
     assumed resolved.
   - Commercial payers' (Aetna/Cigna/UnitedHealthcare) national
     clinical-necessity policies and coding mechanics are the SAME
     documents already verified in vob/georgia.ts — reused here as
     the same primary sources, not duplicated research. No
     Massachusetts-specific override of their coding/reimbursement
     mechanics was found for any of the three.

   TABLE — no listing of which STCs (30, MH, A4-A8, etc.) the 271 actually
   returns financial detail for, and no statement on deductible/copay/
   coinsurance treatment for ABA-flavored codes. None of the other
   plan-specific EDI/claims documents already cited in this file
   (WELLSENSE_EDI_CG, TUFTS_270_271_CG, MGB_CLAIMS_PAGE, the Carelon/Beacon

/* -------------------- Layer 7: contact & channel sources --------------------
   Sourcing notes for this layer (read before editing):
   - MBHP/Fallon/HNE: the Carelon/Beacon "Behavioral Health Policy and
     Procedure Manual for Providers | Fallon Health" (same document already
     cited above as FALLON_CARELON_MANUAL, re-fetched and read in full this
     pass) states, in section 1.7/3.1: a National Provider Service Line at
     800-397-1630 (8 a.m.-8 p.m. ET, Mon-Fri) for contracting/credentialing,
     and a Beacon Member Services number (888-421-8861) used throughout the
     document for member eligibility/authorization/claims-status checks and
     complaints. A Claims Hotline (888-249-0478) and an eServices portal
     (beaconhealthoptions.com) are also confirmed. No general correspondence
     fax was found (only an Adverse Incident Report fax, 877-335-5452 -
     deliberately NOT reused here as a general fax since that would misdirect
     routine correspondence). This is a Carelon/Beacon-wide contact set, not
     Fallon-specific, so it is reused for MBHP and HNE (whose ABA
     administrator is also MBHP/Carelon per this file's already-verified
     facts).
   - MassHealth: mass.gov's own "Eligibility Verification System (EVS)
     Overview" page (fetched and read in full this pass) confirms MassHealth
     Customer Service for Providers - Main (800) 841-2900, Mon-Fri 8 a.m.-5
     p.m., TTY/TDD 711, fax (617) 988-8910, and the EVS/POSC portal. This
     independently cross-validates the AVR number (800-554-0042) already
     found in the Carelon/Beacon Fallon manual.
   - Aetna: Aetna's own "Support system: Behavioral Health Provider Manual"
     (cover-dated 8/22, ~46 months old at access date, staleRisk: true;
     fetched and read in full this pass) confirms ABA requires
     precertification by calling the number on the member's ID card; states
     HMO/Medicare Advantage plans call 1-800-624-0756, all other plans call
     1-888-632-3862 (1-888-MDAetna); Provider Service Center hours 8 a.m.-5
     p.m.; Availity.com is the provider portal. No general correspondence fax
     was found (only a tax-ID-change fax, 859-455-8650 - not reused here as a
     general fax for the same reason as above).
   - Cigna: reuses CIGNA_AUTISM_GUIDE (already cited above), which - read in
     full this pass - contains a dedicated "Contacting us" section: Autism
     Care Coordinator team at 877-279-7603 (Mon-Fri 8:30 a.m.-5 p.m. CT) for
     ABA eligibility/benefits/authorization, and a Provider Services
     department at 800-926-2273 (Mon-Fri 7 a.m.-7 p.m. CT) for billing;
     portal Provider.Evernorth.com.
   - UnitedHealthcare/Optum: Provider Express's own "Contact Us" page
     (fetched and read in full this pass) gives a Provider Services line
     (877-614-0484, Mon-Fri 7 a.m.-7 p.m. CT) for credentialing/contracting/
     network status - NOT eligibility or ABA precert specifically - and
     states explicitly: "Call the number on the back of the member's ID card
     for plan-related inquiries," meaning there is no single national
     eligibility/precert line; portal Providerexpress.com.
   - Mass General Brigham Health Plan: MGB's own claims page (already cited
     above as MGB_CLAIMS_PAGE, re-fetched this pass) states a general
     Provider Services number (855-444-4647), a provider portal
     (provider.massgeneralbrighamhealthplan.org), and - critically for
     ABA/BH specifically - that behavioral health claims route to Optum at
     844-451-3518 (HMO/PPO) or 866-262-8067 (Medicare); no Medicaid-specific
     line was distinguished on the page, flagged in the entry below.
   - WellSense: WellSense's own current "Massachusetts Provider Quick
     Reference Guide" (no version/date stamp visible, fetched and read in
     full this pass) gives a Provider Service Center (888-566-0008) and,
     separately, "Behavioral Health Services: Call Carelon Behavioral Health,
     LLC at 866-444-5155" plus a prior-auth fax (617-951-3464) and the
     HealthTrio provider portal. IMPORTANT: this current guide STILL lists
     Carelon as the BH/ABA contact, which sits in tension with this file's
     already-verified fact that WellSense insourced BH administration
     in-house effective 1/1/2026 - flagged as a scripted question below
     rather than silently resolved either way.

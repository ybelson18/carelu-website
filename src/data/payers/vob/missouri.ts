/* ================================================================
   VOB ENRICHMENT — Missouri, Layers 1 (EDI routing crosswalk), 3
   (code-level coverage grid), and 4 (Medicaid rate tables). See
   docs/vob-build.md for the spec.

   Sourcing notes (read before editing):
   - Missouri ABA (Behavior Analysis) is a fee-for-service CARVE-OUT
     under MO HealthNet: even for members enrolled in a MO HealthNet
     Managed Care plan (Healthy Blue, Home State Health, UnitedHealthcare
     Community Plan, Show Me Healthy Kids), ABA is billed to state FFS,
     never to the MCO. So there is exactly ONE Missouri Medicaid EDI
     target — MO HealthNet FFS — and no MCO VOB guides exist for MO
     (already established in missouri.ts prose). The carve-out was
     reconfirmed current this pass from two primary sources newer than
     the 7/2023 statement the corpus previously relied on: the MO
     HealthNet Managed Care Policy Statements "Effective 10/2024"
     (SFY25) and Healthy Blue's own Sep-2025 provider manual, both
     quoting the ABA-to-FFS carve-out verbatim.
   - The eMOMED (MO HealthNet) 5010 270/271 Companion Guide (Dec 2023)
     IS a fetchable static PDF. It documents that managed-care
     enrollment surfaces via EB04='MC' in Loop 2110C (with the ME
     eligibility code in EB05 / 2110C REF02 when REF01='M7') and the
     MCO's plan hotline in Loop 2120C PER04 — there is NO published
     carrier-code -> MCO-name lookup table in the guide (values resolve
     out of the MO HealthNet database / the separate Health Plan Record
     Layout Manual §C-45). The ABA FFS carve-out is a policy/routing
     fact and is NOT exposed as a discrete 271 field. medicaid271Notes
     captures this as verified, not as an unfilled gap.
   - The MO HealthNet Applied Behavioral Analysis fee schedule (an .xlsx
     on the apps.dss.mo.gov static file portal, file-stamped 2026-07-07)
     was retrieved and parsed directly this pass. All ten codes
     (97151-97158, 0362T, 0373T) are covered and priced; the per-code
     rate/tier/max-unit facts below come straight from that file and the
     Behavioral Health Services Manual §1.16 Tables 17-19. Missouri
     prices by rendering-practitioner tier via modifiers (HO = behavior
     analyst/psychologist, HN = assistant behavior analyst, HM = behavior
     technician/RBT billed by the licensed supervisor), plus U8 =
     home/other place of service and TM = telemedicine.
   - The 3 commercial guides (aetna-missouri, cigna-missouri,
     unitedhealthcare-missouri) get Layers 1 + 3 only, per the build
     spec ("Do not attempt commercial rates"). Their code grids reuse
     the same already-verified national clinical policies as the Georgia
     commercial guides (CPB 0554/0648, EN0499, Optum SCC/2022RP501A),
     which publish no coding/reimbursement mechanics — those fields ship
     'unverified' with a verifyVia, not invented. Missouri's autism
     mandate (RSMo 376.1224: the $40k/yr ABA cap through age 18, applying
     to fully-insured plans only) is noted where relevant.
